Yes it will be a good idea to all have fast horses ready at this rate.<a href="#n03" class="internal_link">3</a> I have written Alger I want an itemised statement of where the money has gone and for Mr Rumsey &amp; <span class="persName">

         </span> to know— for the <span class="tei_orgName_xml:id_canal.cs tei_orgName">ditch</span> is costing to much. And Mead may be able to give some valuable advise. I want him to make a report— so I can show it to the co— George— Your foreman like Burke<a href="#n04" class="internal_link">4</a> last fall must be just killing time with his men— instead of makeing them work to advantage You should be able to tell by this time if you would look them over at work if they were working for our interest. Something fearfully wrong some place George. An awful leak that must be <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="stopped​">stoped</a> at once— I have rec<span class="sup">d</span> no<del>t</del> report for months what has been done— Everything neglected. </p>
