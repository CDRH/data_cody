any idea of how much it will take to keep present force until election. and the entire indebtedness of Co— If you people would get up energy enough at that end to write a business letter. You could not tell as you <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="don't​">dont</a> know who Alger has paid— And Alger <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="wouldn't​">wouldnt</a> tell Christ.</div>

      <p>You folks from Sheridan <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="won't​">wont</a> leave me to carry the responsibility in ignorance— If I had a few stenographers and clerks I would write more</p>
