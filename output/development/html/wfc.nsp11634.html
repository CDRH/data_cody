      <p>Our cartoon this week gives an idea of the latest development of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. The advent of the Shulis African savages renders another visit to the show almost a necessity of such as are students of ethnology. The singing of the Shulis is undoubtedly musical albeit of a somewhat wierd and pliantive sweetness; while certain of their dances (barring the costumes) could with advantage be incorporated in some of our ball programmes, so dignified and graceful both in action and time are the movements. The intelligence of the Elephants as displayed in their performance is a scource of astonishment and wonder to every one; and certainly Nellie is well worthy of a new bright coloured frill to gladden her feminine heart, as a reward for her really too utterly comical and clever efforts to please he[r] audience.</p>
