      <h3>BUFFALO BILL INDIANS.</h3>

      <p>The Sioux Indians who went to Europe with Buffalo Bill, and who since their return have been held at Fort Sheridan, practically as prisoners of war, will, with the exception of the two unruly ones, Short Bull and Kicking Bear, be allowed to return to their people in a few days.</p>
