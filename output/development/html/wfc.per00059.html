      <h3>"Buffalo Bill" to Uncle Sam.</h3>

      <p>[Colonel the Hon. W. F. Cody has written to a friend in America, stating that our atmosphere is too limited for him to breathe in freely, and our island too small to permit of his taking equestrian exercise in it conveniently.]</p>

      <span class="tei_lg">
         <span class="tei_l">DEAR SAM.—I want to get back home, I do:</span>
         <span class="tei_l">I'm stifled here. I darn't breathe. I tell <span class="italic">you</span>,</span>
         <span class="tei_l">For fear of robbing some one else of air.</span>
         <span class="tei_l">Of which they haven't half a sniff to spare.</span>
         <span class="tei_l">Their atmosphere's made up of fog and soot;</span>
         <span class="tei_l">The people tread each other under foot;</span>
         <span class="tei_l">They swarm as thick as Californian fleas,—</span>
         <span class="tei_l">At every throw I'd lasso ten with ease.</span>
         <span class="tei_l">Their biggest county would not make a farm</span>
         <span class="tei_l">Out West,—you, Sam, could hold it in your palm!</span>
         <span class="tei_l">In fact, their island's so tarnation small,</span>
         <span class="tei_l">I dar'n't ride far, lest in the sea I'd fall—</span>
         <span class="tei_l">On their "d—d railways" I've scarce left one station </span>
         <span class="tei_l">Before I'm told I'm at my destination.</span>
         <span class="tei_l">In short, I haven't room to freely stand, </span>
         <span class="tei_l">Much less to move on this mere scrap of land.</span>
         <span class="tei_l">P.S.—I must not fail to let you know</span>
         <span class="tei_l">We've done a wondrous business with the show:</span>
         <span class="tei_l">The British shekels have pour'd in like rain,</span>
         <span class="tei_l">And if I thought 'twould pay, I'd come again;</span>
         <span class="tei_l">But as I fancy no more's to be got,</span>
         <span class="tei_l">I'll tell you what I think of England—rot!</span>
      </span>
