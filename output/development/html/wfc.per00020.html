      </h3>
                <p>Once in a while we hear of an imitator of the great Scout and Plainsman.

Up to now, none have succeeded in attracting even the slightest attention, but <span class="bold">We've Discovered a Character</span> who is bound to make all the Bill's and Pete's and Ike's and Jake's of the West green with envy.  One who studied Buffalo Bill through his weekly magazine and then scurried westward to get into action.</p>
