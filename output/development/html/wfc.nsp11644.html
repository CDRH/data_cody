      <h3>BUFFALO BILL'S WILD WEST COWBOY BAND.</h3>

      <p>This band, which delighted the large audiences attending Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show in the East-end Exhibition, visits Greenock to-night to give a concert, in the Town Hall, the programme for which will be composed of the best selections of American music. The Arlberger Tyrolean Singers, who took a prominent part in one of the "episodes" at Glasgow, are announced to render some of their native glees and part-songs, which should prove a great attraction. Indians, of the Sioux tribe—who gave the United States authorities so much trouble at Pine Ridge Agency —will go trough some of their war dances and the ghost dance which attracted so much attention during the recent rebellion.</p>
