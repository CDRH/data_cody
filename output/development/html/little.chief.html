      <div class="note">Little Chief (b.1851), next in authority to Red Shirt, was a sub-chief of the Oglala Lakota at Pine Ridge Reservation, with family ties to the Sicangu at Rosebud Reservation. Little Chief appeared with Buffalo Bill's Wild West from 1887 through 1892 and possibly longer. British newspapers of the time reported that "Good Robe" was the name of Little Chief's wife and the mother of daughter Frances Victoria Alexandra.</div>
