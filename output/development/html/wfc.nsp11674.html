      <h3>BUFFALO BILL'S HUNTING.</h3>

      <h3>His Remarkable Exploit With an Outfit That Excited <span class="unclear ">Derring-do[?]</span>.</h3>

      <p>[New York Dispatch:] A lively little story of hunting is told by Buffalo Bill. A herd had been sighted from camp, and the famous ranger at once jumped on his horse in quest of fresh meat, of which he and his companions were in great need. </p>

      <p>"While I was riding toward the buffaloes, I saw five horsemen from the fort, who were eviden[t]ly going out for a chase. They proved to be newly-arrived officers—a captain and his lieutenants. 'Hello, my friend,' sang out the captain. 'I see that you are after the same game that we are.' 'Yes, sir,' said I.</p>

      <p>"They scanned my cheap outfit very closely, and, as my horse looked like a work horse, and had on only a blind bridle, they evidently considered me a green hand at hunting. 'Do you expect to catch these buffaloes on that Gothic steed?' laughed the captain. 'I hope so, by pushing hard enough on the reins,' was my reply. 'You'll never catch them in the world, my fine fellow' said he. 'It takes a fast horse to do that.' 'Does it?' asked I, as if I didn't know. 'Yes; but come along with us, for we are going to kill them more for pleasure than anything else. All we want are the tongues and a piece of tenderloin, and you may have all that is left.' 'I'm much obliged to you, captain,' said I, carelessly. 'I'll follow you.'</p>

      <p>"There were eleven buffaloes in the herd, and they were not more than a mile ahead. I saw they were making toward the creek for water, and I started up that way to head them off, while the officers came up in the rear and gave chase. The animals came rushing past me, not one hundred yards distant, with the officers 300 yards in the rear. I pulled the blind bridle off my horse, and he, a trained hunter, knew exactly what to do. He started at the top of his speed and brought me alongside the rear buffalo. I raised my gun, fired, and killed the animal at the first shot. My horse then carried me alongside the next one, and I dropped him at the next fire. Thus I killed the eleven buffaloes with twelve shots, and as the last animal dropped, my horse stopped. Remember, I had been riding him without bridle, reins, or saddle, but I jumped to the ground, knowing he would not leave me. </p>
 
      <p>"The astonished officers were just riding up. 'Now gentlemen,' said I, 'allow me to present you with all the tongues and tenderloins you want.' 'Well,' said the captain, 'I never say the like before. Why under the sun are you, anyhow?' 'My name is Cody.' 'That horse of yours certainly has running points.' 'Yes, sir; you're right; he has not only the points, but he knows how to use them.' 'So I noticed.'" </p>
