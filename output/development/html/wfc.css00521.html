I have no idea of what is owed out there. Why <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="don't​">dont</a> you let some of us know. is it right that the members of our Co are not informed of their obligations. I should think you would be glad to tell them. So you would not be bothered with creditors. So far I have been unable to get any one but <span class="persName">
