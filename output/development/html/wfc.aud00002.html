      <p>It is a great pleasure to see this wonder working man at his task and to find
that though he is super man to all the world, he is very human at home and among
those who labor with him.</p>

      <p>He has made the dynamo that has changed the world. It seems almost uncanny that
the voice in this place can be perpetuated and that he has set out to the world
his phonograph, which have given more entertainment and pleasure than any
invention in the history of the world.</p>
