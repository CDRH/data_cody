and very soon you will have our <span class="tei_orgName_xml:id_company.s tei_orgName">company</span> in an <del>af</del> awful mix up We are aware that every thing at that end is run like a widow woman farm.

      <p>You say you had seed oats on the ground. if so why did Nagle<a href="#n03" class="internal_link">3</a> have to go after oats? I know why the horses could not stand the work. There was no care taken of them nor no judgement used. When they were first out to work— they were killed the first day. of course the breaking <del>of</del> up &amp; <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="moving​">mooveing</a> of camp was a big expense. Because there was no system about it. And the Boss was not on the job until 11 am</p>

      <p>George— I am speaking plain. I am getting the blame for this kind of management and I propose to land the blame where it belongs I am sick and tired of nonsense— and will stand it no longer— Business has got to be done on business principles or as the others say. I will say my self I will not put up another dollar and give my reasons for so doing. I was in hopes you would quit nonsense and get down to business—</p>
