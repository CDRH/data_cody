         <h4>Grand Festive Preparations.</h4>

         <p>St. Louis, Mo., January 15.—The Legislature of Missouri has adopted a resolution for the appointment of a committee, consisting of six members of the House and four of the Senate, to which the Governor, Lieutenant Governor and Speaker of the House were added, to make arrangements for the reception of the Grand Duke Alexis and suite at the State capital on their return from the buffalo hunt.</p>

         <p>The steamer Great Republic, which is to convey Alexis and his suite to New Orleans, will undergo some changes for the purpose. Two of the large staterooms will be thrown into one, newly carpeted, and furnished with a set of chamber furniture. A billiard table will be placed in the rear cabin, and other arrangements made to break the monotony of the trip. Besides the suite, none but the officers of the boat will be allowed on board during the passage. Especially will all newspaper men be excluded, a special agreement having been made to this effect.</p>
