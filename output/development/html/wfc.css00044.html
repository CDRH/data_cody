   <div class="note">Note 1: Cody did not include the year in the dateline of this letter, but contextual evidence points to the year 1879.  See note 2 below.</div>
  
   <div class="note">Note 2: Very likely the poem  "Cody's Corral, or, the Scouts and the Sioux," which was later reprinted in programs for Buffalo Bill's Wild West as early as 1885.  The 1885 program gave credit for the poem to "Buckskin Sam."  In a letter to Hall dated May 23, 1879, Cody refers to the poem as "Cody's Corrall."</div>
