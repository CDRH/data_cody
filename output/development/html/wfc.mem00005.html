         <h3>PREFACE</h3>


         <p>IT is usually customary in presenting a book of this kind to friends and the public to offer an apology, but the authors of this book have no apology to make, as neither one of us are authors or poets, but simply employees of the BUFFALO BILL WILD WEST COMPANY; and in an honest endeavor to earn our salaries and write a book at the same time is hard enough without going through the humiliation of offering an apology for our work, when we did the best we could under existing circumstances.</p>

         <p>We have tried to avoid the lionizing of one class of people or overlooking others, but to give a correct account of things as they occurred. There may have been some mistakes made, and some things overlooked; for this we simply ask forbearance—nothing more.</p>

         <p>Our principal object has been to have a book as near correct as possible, and one that would receive the approval of our fellow-workmen during the Season of 1896.</p>

            <h4>Louisville, Ky.</h4>
            <p>WEDNESDAY, May 13. Arrived in town at 4.30 A. M. Had a two-mile haul to lot. We put up every yard of canvas and every seat we had. Cowboy Ed. Goodrich was thrown in the bucking act and secured three ugly scalp wounds. J. T. McCaddon returned this morning from Chicago. Our new buffalo calf commenced his show career to-day and went around the arena with its mother in the buffalo hunt, making quite a hit. J. G. Elgin, of B. &amp; O. S. W. R. R. and Dr. H. Ray Cannon were guests of Fred Hutchinson.</p>

            <p>Business in the afternoon good, in the evening big.</p>

Sapp, of the Annex, consequently he had lots of company all the day. His father and mother and two brothers spent most of the day with him. A street car ran into the back end of the plank wagon, No. 43, in the evening, smashing the front end of ths car but with no damage to the wagon. As usual in such cases the show was held up to the tune of $10.00.</p>

            <p>SUNDAY, May 17. Arrived in town at 1.30 P. M., a good run considering distance traveled. Everything on the lot at 4.30, and all up before dark. Byrns, the Irish soldier, who left at Cumberland, Md., joined us again to-day and went on duty. Nate Salsbury, manager of the Wild West, came on from Chicago, and met us at the lot to-day. We found the lot large but uneven, with every indication of being bad in wet weather. J. Allen Darnaby tells an amusing story, much to the delight of Messrs. Hutchinson, Showles and Stanton.</p>

            <p>MONDAY, May, 18. We opened with the worst kind of weather—it was warm and sultry all day; at 9.30 A. M.  a heavy thunder-storm, and another one at 10.15; it was so severe that the concert audience left in a body after the second act. Mrs. 


Col. W. F. Cody and daughter Irma, of North Platte, Neb., came on for a short visit. The Hawleys joined the Annex here to-day.</p>

            <p>TUESDAY, May, 19. Weather very bad—rained hard all morning. There was a severe electric storm that lasted from 7 until 11 P. M.; it put the arena in a frightful condition. The storm did us no harm, only from a business standpoint. We wondered that anyone came. Nate Salsbury returned to Chicago to-day. Johnny Baker made quite a hit in his act, when he stood on his head in the mud.</p>

            <p>WEDNESDAY, May 20. Our superintendent, Jas. P. Anderson, was caught back of the bronco tent this morning praying for clear weather, and as usual the change was quick and favorable. At 10 A. M. the sun commenced shining for the first time in three days, consequently we had a fair house in the afternoon and a big house in the evening, and Mr. Anderson smiled for the first time this week,; in fact it was the only smile we saw during the engagement.</p>

            <p>THURSDAY, May 21. Another storm this morning, which put the arena in a frightful condition.  At 5.30 P. M. a hail-storm from the southwest, and hail-stones fell that measured 2 3/4 x 1 3/4 inches. No harm done outside of breaking twelve arc-lamp globes. Business light as a natural consequence.</p>

            <p>FRIDAY, May 22. To-day the weather cleared up a little and gave one good day, consequently good business; every chair in the house was sold at 7.30. Col. Cody's horse fell this afternoon and caught his foot, but did him no injury. Cowboys Bill Brace and Bob Wilkinson were thrown to-night in the bucking horse act. The Order of the Mystic Shrine came out in a body to see us to-night.</p>


            <p>SATURDAY, May 23. Weather moderately fair, and business on the light side. Jockey rider Joe Campbell's horse fell and caught him, and he was carried out in a helpless condition. It was found that he had dislocated his shoulder, besides having a badly strained neck. Eddie Holland ammunition man, who was left in the Cincinnati Hospital, joined us this morning. The arena still remained in a frightful condition.</p>

            <p>SUNDAY, May 24. We gave two shows to-day for the first time on Sunday since we were at the World's Fair, Chicago. Business fair in the afternoon, but at night we had the lightest house of the season up to date. We had a hard pick-up at night, as everything had to be carried off of the lot. Taking the week as a whole, it has been a hard one—severe storms, lot in bad condition, and every one glad to get away. Lot, Manchester Road and Compton Ave. Arena, 222 x 451.</p>

All work was stopped, and every one got on top of wagons, except Mr. Anderson, who got under one, and no amount of persuasion could get him out until the buffalo was safe in the car.</p>

M. in order to meet them in town. Parade returned at 12.15 P. M.  Cowboy John Franz, who had his arm broken in Clarkesburg, commenced riding to-day. Hadj Sherriff, Arab Dervish Dancer, joined to-day.

            <p>Attendance, afternoon 2,403. Evening 3,922.</p>

            <p>Weather clear.</p>

            <p>TUESDAY, June 2. Weather cool and cloudy; commenced to rain at 7 P. M. and rained all night. E. Redmond and James Clark, back-wall canvas-


men, got to fighting with the janitor and both were arrested this morning and sent to the Bridewell for 113 days. The Prentices, who were with the Annex last season, visited us to-day.

Salem Nasser, Arabian strong man, was taken to the hospital to-day sick with typhoid fever. Ticket seller Ed. Showles went through the surgical operation of having his palates cut yesterday, and his senatorial voice was not heard all day. The silence was painful to us, who were used to it. He managed to work by pantomime, with some degree of success.</p>

            <p>THURSDAY, June 4. Weather fine. Superintendent of our canvas, Thomas Fay, left to-day for a few days' visit home at St. Charles, Minn. Henry H. Cross, an old-time manager and animal trainer, Charles and John Ringling were guests of the show to-day. We had opposition to-day on a small scale by an Uncle Tom's Cabin Co., located two blocks from us, with ten-cent show; it, however, seemed to do us no damage.</p>
 
            <p>Attendence, afternoon  2,312, evening 6,271.</p>

            <p>FRIDAY, June 5. Weather fine. Kerry Meager, contracting agent of the Ringling Bros., and Wm. Harvell, an old-time circus treasurer, were guests to-day. John Tippets went to the hospital sick to-day.</p>
 
            <p>Attendance, 2,578 in the afternoon, 4,103 in the evening.</p>

            <p>SATURDAY, June 6. Weather fine. Louis Barrett and Peter Sells, of the Forepaugh-Sells Show and John Ringling, of the Ringling Bros. Show, were guests again to-night. Our first week in Chicago was a success in every particular, and people seemed pleased with the performance under cover.</p>

            <p>Attendance, afternoon 6,996, evening 10,559.</p>


            <p>SUNDAY, June 7. Very warm in the morning, but at 3.30 a heavy storm, accompanied with a fierce wind, came up and lasted for an hour. It was the nearest thing to a cyclone that we have had this season, but we suffered no loss. We had a turn-away in the afternoon, but managed to take care of the people at night. James E. Taylor, groom in the bronco tent, was taking a horse into the building during the storm when a door blew shut and caught him; his right hand was broken and he received several severe bruises on the right leg. Brock Connor, third assistant on canvas, closed to-day.</p>

            <p>Attendance, in the afternoon 11,064, evening 5,127.</p>

            <p>MONDAY, June 8. Weather cold and rainy. To-night there was a new act put on for the first time, entitled, "A Horse Fair." All of our draft horses were taken out after the Arabs had completed their act. The horses were marched around the arena in pairs and the act took well with the public, the horses behaving very well. Cowboy Bob Wilkinson closed to-day on account of lameness. Fred Hawley and wife of the Annex also closed to-day. Nate Salsbury left to-day for New York City.</p>

            <p>Attendance, afternoon 2,794, evening 5,109.</p>

            <p>Attendance, afternoon 3,592, evening 7,108.</p>

            <p>WEDNESDAY, June 10. Weather fine. Fursman smiled to-day for the first time since our engagement here, as the result of a turn-away from the big show. A few people strayed in to see him.</p>

            <p>Attendance, afternoon 5,219, evening, 10,976.</p>

            <p>THURSDAY, June 11. Weather fine. Gen. Welsey Merritt and staff visited the show this afternoon. Chas Higley, Cowboy, was thrown from his horse this afternoon. Salem Nasser, Arabian strong man, who went to Mercy Hospital one week ago with typhoid fever, died at 12 o'clock last night. He was twenty-seven years of age, born in Sheuerrie, Asia, where he leaves a wife and two children. He joined the Buffalo Bill Wild West Company in Brooklyn, N. Y., season of '94 and again in '96. This is the first time death has visited our camp this season, and of the whole number of employees the best specimen of physical manhood was taken. He was respected by all who knew him and expressions of regret were heard around the camp all day.</p>

            <p>Attendance, afternoon 5,307, evening 11,419.</p>

            <p>FRIDAY, June 12. Weather bad, cold northwest wind accompanied with fine rain. Thomas Fay,</p>


            <p>Superintendent of Canvas, returned this morning from St. Charles, Minn., where he has been on a week's visit home. U.S. Senator W. V. Allen, of Nebraska, was a guest of the show this evening.</p>

            <p>Attendance, afternoon 3,889, evening 8,547.</p>

            <p>SATURDAY, June 13. Weather fine. Salem Nasser was buried this morning at 10 A. M. in St. Mary's Cemetery. All performers attended the funeral in uniform. Chas. Higley was thrown in the bucking-horse act this afternoon and had to be carried out of the arena. He sustained no injury except a bad shaking up. Cowboy Ed. Hughes laid up with an attack of pneumonia. To-night makes our one-hundredth performance this season without missing a show, a railroad accident or a blow-down. This is remarkable, when it is taken into consideration the number of storms that has visited the country this spring. The strong-box of our treasury might contain fewer shekels to-day were it not for the coolness and quiet wits of a brave woman. This woman, whose name is Mrs. John Kenon, prevented a daring hold up on the ticket offices to-night, making it possible for the police to capture the plotters. The hold-up of the Deadwood Stage Coach was nothing to the projected robbery of to-night. At nine o'clock to-night, Mrs. Kenon, who lives at 6345 Washington

avenue, was standing on the rear porch of her house, when she noticed two men walking up the alley. One of them seemed to be trying to persuade his companion, who was a tough-looking individual, to commit some kind of a daring deed. The actions of the men interested Mrs. Kenon, and she remained hidden behind some vines and listened to the conversation. </p>

            <p>"Now when you get the money shove it into the bag and I will cover you with the gun," said the smaller man. "Then you run down this alley to Sixty-fourth street, where it will be dead easy for you to get out of the way in the dark. As soon as they start to count the money at the east window you go to the other end of the building and you 'fire' and then come back again, when I will make the ticket agent throw up his hands, when we will both get out of the way, and I will meet you later at Sixty-first street and Stony Island avenue."</p>

            <p>Mrs. Kenon had heard enough to convince her that the two men were planning an attack on our receipts. She ran hastily to the Woodlawn Station, where she told Matron Rice what she had overheard. Lieut. Musser was informed of the facts and, hastily calling several officers, he surrounded the entrances to the alley, and then closed in on the two plotters. At the station the men gave their names as Lynch and Thomas Cooley. Lynch


claims that Cooley planned the hold-up and provided the revolvers. Capt. Shippy thinks Lynch is wanted by the Newark police. </p>

            <p>Attendance, afternoon 10,386, evening 11,706.</p>

            <p>SUNDAY, June 14. Weather fine. Charles Herbert, Col. Cody's private coachman, left us to-day. William Dunbar, Superintendent of the Annex canvas, and all of his men quit to-night. Lew Hawkins, of the Annex, also quit to-night. In our move to-night one of our buffaloes got away and created a great deal of excitement on Sixty-third street. He had to be lassoed and led to the train. Our family relations broke up completely to-day; Mrs. Col. W. F. Cody and daughter Irma left for North Platte, Neb.; Mrs. Jule Keene and Mrs. Sweeney left for Aetna, Ill.; Mrs. J. T. McCaddon and Mrs. Hutchinson left for Philadelphia; Mrs. William McCune left for Omaha, Neb.; Mrs. M. B. Bailey returned to her home in Evanston, Ill.; Mrs. Harry Gray left for New York City. We closed a very successful two weeks engagement at the Coliseum building. Dimensions of buildings 300 x 750; arena, 157 x 418; number of chairs in building, 12,049.</p>

She is known in different States by different nicknames. In Kansas it is "Little Blue"; in Missouri as "The Woman in Blue"; in Indiana as "True Blue." She is something of a writer and a poet. Her make-up was certainly original, and I do not believe that any of us ever saw anything like it before. As is usual with such characters, she claimed close acquaintance with Col. Wm. F. Cody. The weather was the warmest we have experienced this season. At 2 P. M. it was 102 degrees in the shade. A heavy thunder-storm came up at 8 P. M. and rained hard until 10.30. We received a good soaking taking down the canvas.</p>

recent rains. Consequently all teams were doubled in going on the lot. Our own Annie Oakley was happy to-day; her mother, brother, three sisters and their six children were at the show to-day. It was the first time they had ever seen the show and they drove thirty miles to get here. Every one joined with Annie in trying to make things pleasant for them. We all did a little patriotic decorating to-day. It was especially noticeable in the dining tent; every table was covered with flags and bunting, every plate bore a flag of our great nation except one, who, not being a native, and not having taken out his naturalization papers was not entitled to it, but nevertheless Brogan is a good fellow. Three rousing cheers were given for the Colonel at the proposal of George Burch, Chief of Cowboys. The Colonel replied with a nice little speech, which contained many good wishes and much good advice. Harry Speigle, the venerable ticket-taker at the side-show door, received an ovation as he came into the dining tent to-day, this being his sixty-seventh birthday and his forty-second year in the show business. Every one wished him a continuance of good health and prosperity. Harry replied by a neat little speech, which was heartily cheered by the entire company. Taking all in all to-day was a great Fourth. The street-car system gave out this evening and the patrons of the night


show had to walk home. Weather very warm throughout the whole day; a heavy rain-storm at 7 P. M., which continued all the evening.</p>

McCaddon, Jule Keen, Fred and Charles Hutchinson, and Orator J. J. McCarthy went to Cincinnati and paid a visit to the Pawnee Bill Wild West Show. They were entertained by Pawnee Bill, May Lillie, and Chief of Cowboys Heck Quinn, who is an old Wild West man. Annie Oakley remained over in Piqua last evening and joined us again to-day. James P. Anderson was seen sitting in the marque to-day for several hours figuring faithfully: he left the ground covered with paper and one piece was picked up containing the following figures: 4 days 96 hours, 5,760 minutes, 345,600 seconds. It was passed around the camp all day and no one solved the problem until it came to Mrs. George Fursman, of the Annex; to her, she said, it was as plain as day, and that Mr. Anderson was going home to

Columbus, Ohio, next Friday, to see his wife. She was correct, for he left on Friday for Columbus. Heavy rain at 2 P. M. which lasted until 4 P. M. Orders were issued to-day that no employee would be allowed to ride on wagons either to or from lots.</div>

            <p>MONDAY, July 6. Weather very warm and sultry with heavy clouds all day, which at night brought us our usual thunder-storm. G. L. Burch, Chief of the Cowboys, and Cowboy Walter Scott were thrown from their horses to-day during the bucking-horse act. Jake Platt, first assistant superintendent of canvas, was presented with a lovely coffee-cup at the staff table. It bore the beautiful inscription of "Grandpa" on the side; it was from the waiter of that table.</p>

            <p>TUESDAY, July 7. Arrived in town at 5 A. M. Two-mile haul to lot. If ever Anderson prayed for still weather he did to-day. We could not get a stake down over twelve inches anywhere and the least wind would have blown us down, but with our


usual good luck we came out all right. Refreigo Carrello, a Mexican, was thrown in the grand entree to-day; his left shoulder was badly hurt and sprained and he received a lot of small bruises and was badly used up. Master-Mechanic Dan Taylor left to-day for Columbus, Ohio, to get the grounds ready for our next Monday's engagement.</p>

Watson, an American soldier, had a saber run through his left ear during the military drill. While Engineer C. H. Crowell was down-town this morning he was arrested on suspicion of being connected with a $900.00 robbery; he was taken to headquarters, searched and let go. Reserve seats were sold to-day for 25 cents each for the first time this season. William Sloan, second cook, closed to-day.</p>

            <p>THURSDAY, July 9. Arrived in town at 4.30 A. M. Two-mile haul to lot, which was in bad condition owing to the recent heavy rains. We arrived in one of the worst rains since the "flood," and it kept up all day. We managed to wade through with the afternoon performance, and at 4 P. M. orders came to tear down, that no night show would be given. It showed good judgment upon the part of the management, for the last wagon never left the lot until 12:30 A. M. The cook-house wagon broke a wheel, which delayed things several hours. Altogether, it was the worst rain and the worst lot we have had so far this season.</p>

I do not believe it is possible for any show outfit to look worse than we did this morning. Our clothes, usually like "Jacob's coat of many colors," were not so now; wagons, canvas, horses, clothes, etc., all looked alike, the color of Lima mud. No show was ever donated more real estate by one town than we had donated to us at Lima. The cook-house wagon, the same one that broke a wheel last night, broke down again this morning. Vicente P. Orapeza, Chief of the Mexicans, was laid up sick in the cars all day as a result of yesterday's wet weather. J. P. Anderson left at 2 P. M. to day for Columbus, Ohio, in order to have a few days' visit at home. George Brudell, who had charge of the range wagon, with the cook-house, left to-day for Cleveland sick. The 75 cent reserve seat sale was tried to-day. Two lengths of reserves were put up

of this evening, in commenting upon the parade, said "that the Show had two steam caliopes, but they could not play either one of them, but that the people appreciated them just the same." Kinura, the Japanese magician of the Annex, closed to-day on account of ill health and left for New York. This is the French Fourth of July, and the French soldiers did all they could in a small way to celebrate. Just as the audience was dismissed this evening we had the hardest rain of the season. It was more severe than any of us had ever witnessed—old showmen having never seen its equal. It put out a beacon-light, and, as is quite a common case, the electric street railway was disabled just as the people desired to get home. All our teams had to be doubled in order to get our stuff all off of the lot, and the last wagon did not leave until 12:30.</p>

            <p>Charlie Kershaw joined the Annex to-day. This is the home of the father of our manager, J. T. McCaddon, and as a natural consequence he met many of his friends and relatives. It rained hard in the afternoon and again at night.</p>

To-day, the most serious and saddest accident of the season happened, which came very near terminating the lives of several of our side show musicians. During parade this morning, the eight horses attached to the second band wagon, upon which rides the side show band, passed under the steel overhead bridge of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The parade was laid out to go under the side of the bridge, which is depressed several feet to allow the passage of electric street cars. The parade started under the depressed side, but a street car coming up from the opposite direction compelled the parade to go under the other side. The driver of the eight-horse band wagon did not notice that the bridge was low, nat-

urally following in the wake of the others, who, being all mounted people, could very easily pass under the bridge. The leaders of the team were under the bridge before the driver noticed that it was too low, but then it was too late for him to check his team. The heavy steel structure scraped the men from their seats like ten-pins. Screams and cries from the wounded men rent the air, and the wagon had just appeared on the opposite side of the bridge before the team came to a halt. The wounded men were taken down from the wagon and every attention possible was afforded them; doctors and ambulances were telephoned to come to the scene and render their assistance. It was no time before four or five of the best physicians that Massillon affords were there, and the summary of the injured men was as follows:</p>

            <p>Antonio Grancioso, chest crushed, shoulder broken in two places, head cut, fatal results expected; Domenico Flucco, crushed about heart, condition most serious; Dave Denio (Davie Keene), leg broken, head cut and badly bruised; Alfred Vitelli, collar-bone broken; G. Moccia, back injured and face cut; Philip Reichia, cut and bruised about the head and body. All of the injured men were taken to the Aultman Hospital, eight miles distant, with the exception of Antonio Grancioso, whose condition was too serious to permit of his removal from the 


hotel.  The latest report from all was that they were resting quietly and doing nicely.</p>

            <p>Another accident happened this afternoon. Tom Oliver (Cossack Tom), the Cossack interpreter, was standing back of the back wall while Johnnie Baker, the Young American marksman, was doing his act. In shooting at the pigeons, one of the shots went through the side wall and struck Tom in the eye and another went through the left ear, and he will in all probability be seen around the camp with a bandage on his head for several days. Barney Link, an old-time Wild West man, but now manager of the American Bill-posting Co., of Brooklyn, N. Y., paid us a visit to-day while on his way to Milwaukee. General Coxey was at the show this afternoon, but minus his army. Dan Taylor left to-day for Cleveland to get the lot in readiness for our opening there next Monday.</p>

the mud for the past two weeks, but we have not, as yet, found anything to equal this. In the arena were three old circus rings and all were full of water, consequently it took a great deal of civil engineering to drain the lot so as to be in condition to give a performance. In loading at night all wagons were run off of the lot empty and everything was carried to them. The last wagon left the lot at 12.30. Basker Hadj Ali, one of our Arabian boys, was taken sick and sent to Cleveland Hospital; he had an attack of typhoid fever.</div>

As usual, as has been the case during the past few weeks, it took from twelve to sixteen horses on a wagon; the last wagon did not get on the lot until 12.30 P.M. We started on Eastern time here and, in consequence, were one-half hour late with the afternoon performance. Edwin Aiken, stenographer and secretary to J. T. McCaddon, left for Geneva, Ohio, to-day to spend Sunday with his

 
mother. We got down the hill safely at night and closed up the hardest week that the Wild West show has ever had for two years. We have had to dig more drainage canals during the last two weeks than we did during the whole of the season of 1895 all put together. What is still in store for us we of course do not know, but it certainly cannot be much worse than this last week has been on men and horses.</p>

When "Old Glory" was announced this evening no "flag" appeared; a silent wait and still no "Old Glory," the next number was announced and came on. The cause of it being that the American Standard-bearer, Paul H. Weinert, was asleep in the dressing-room, and his comrades had neglected to


awaken him. As a consequence there was a combing of hair back of the curtain for a few moments, but, as is usual, it was soon all forgotten. A great surprise awaited us this evening at the cook-tent; it was "chicken," and I think that the singular of the word comes nearer striking it than anything else, for upon investigation it was found that there were only nine small chickens, and the first to arrive at the cook-tent naturally received it all on the staff table; those who were not fortunate enough to get there did "some kicking"; if you don't believe it, ask J. Allen Darnaby.</p>

We were unable to get a wagon on the lot, either in going on or coming off at night. Everything had to be carried to the wagons in the street and men sank up to their knees in mud. A rumor got afloat that only one show would be given, so the band wagon containing the Cowboy Band was sent down town between the shows and an announcement made that there would be an evening show.</p>

All the front door men had to take a hand in getting ready this morning, and, as is usual with that class of people, they took what was the easiest to do—spread sawdust. The horse of Salem Hadj, one of the Arabian boys, fell with him to-day and sprained his right knee. To-day closes up our third week in Ohio, and we are all happy to get out of this State. Out of the eighteen stands we have had nine days hard rain and seventeen muddy lots, Toledo being the only dry lot we have had, and it is something to be proud of.

up again to-day. Chas. Hutchinson, Joe Quaid, Charles Ramsey, Charles Petty, Harry Barnum, Fred Hutchinson and Edwin Aiken went to Mt. Clemens, Mich., to see the worst game of ball that was ever played. They stood up in a car all the way out and starved all the way back. They had a lay-out of several hours, and finally reached the city at 1.30 A. M., a poor but wiser lot of men.</div>

            <p>Weather cloudy, and heavy wind and rain at night. It did no damage to our canvas, but only made the mud deeper on the lot.</p>

            <p>MONDAY, July 27. It was an utter impossibility to walk across the lot this morning without wearing rubber boots, as the water was a foot deep in some places, but drains were soon made, and by noon everything was in readiness for the afternoon performance. P. J. Stanton, of the Annex, returned from Brooklyn to-day, and it seems natural to see "Pete's" face around again, and to hear him tell of the wonders which could be found in the Annex. Bucking-horse "Jubilee" fell to-day with rider Chas. Higley, who received a badly sprained knee. Maj. Burke's genial countenance was seen to-day for the first time since Chicago. Weather cloudy and threatening all day but no rain.</p>

            <p>Business in the afternoon fair, at night big.</p>


            <p>TUESDAY, July 28. Geo. Goodman, superintendent of the programme, resigned to-day and left for Duluth, Minn., where he will take charge of the Duluth <span class="italic">Press.</span> W. R. Harburger was appointed in his place. J. D. Nagle, Emigrant Commissioner for the Big Horn Basin Land Company, was a guest of Col. W. F. Cody to-day. Chas. Trego, the old superintendent of the bronco stable, gave us a call to-day while on his way to the Big Horn Basin. W. H. Lushbaugh, maker of our canvas, of Covington, Ky., was a guest of Manager J. T. McCaddon to-day. Manager Nate Salsbury came in to-night from the Big Horn Basin. We had a hard pack-up to-night, as everything had to be carried off of the lot and loaded, and the mud was knee-deep. It was 12:30 before the last wagon was off the lot.</p>

            <p>Weather cloudy and threatening all day.</p>

            <p>Business in the afternoon light, at night big.</p>

            <p>Lot, Grand River avenue and Hudson street.</p>

haul to the lot. James A. Bailey left the "Greatest Show on Earth" long enough to give us a call this morning, but returned at night. S. H. Davis (Red), an old-time candy butcher, closed to-day and left for Philadelphia. Everyone was sorry to see "Red" go. Both J. A. Bailey and Nate Salsbury left on the evening train for the East.</p>

            <p>Weather fine.</p>

            <h4>Port Huron, Mich.</h4>
            <p>THURSDAY, July 30. Arrived in town at 6.15 A. M. One and a half mile haul to lot. McGreggor and Lowanda's ten cent side-show, that was across the street from us in Toledo, Ohio, and Detroit, Mich., showed up again to-day. This was a "great" opposition, and a better chance for our orators, as they were located very near our Annex, and Messrs. Stanton and Morris distinguished themselves to-day. We were loaded the quickest to-night that we have been this season, all canvas being down before the concert was over.</p>

            <p>Weather clear and fine.</p>


            <p>Business fair at both performances.</p>

            <p>FRIDAY, July 31. Arrived in town at 6 30 A. M One and a half mile haul to lot. To-night we leave the F. &amp; P. M. Railway with regret, as we have received the greatest amount of attention from the officers of this road, and Mr. Potter, the division superintendent, has governed his crew and given us the best of runs, which goes to prove that Mr. Potter is up in his line of railroad business. Cowboy Ed. Hughes' horse jumped the guard-rope to-night, and knocked down an electric light pole, which put out one circuit for about three minutes. He received a sprained knee, and will now be seen around camp for a few days on crutches. Cowboy Abe LeDuke had his left elbow dislocated while trying to mount a bucking horse.</p>

            <p>Business big at both performances.</p>

            <h4>THE FIRM OF PLATT, SPONGE, AND KELLY.</h4>

            <p>This firm was organized in Philadelphia, Pa., April 22, 1895. The object of the organization was to open a barber shop and cater to the trade of the canvasmen connected with the Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show.</p>

            <p>Platt, the senior member of the firm, was the first assistant boss canvasman for the company, and Sponge and Kelly were old-time canvasmen. Platt was to be the silent partner of the firm, but was to furnish all the necessary capital to put the business on a good financial basis. Sponge and Kelly were to do all the work, and the profit was to be divided equally between each member of the firm. Platt bought two razors and a pair of barber shears, got the use of a wheelbarrow from the stake-and-chain wagon to serve as a barber chair, got two old pieces of canvas for towels, stole a bar of soap from the cook-house, and then turned the property over to Sponge and Kelly as a complete outfit, and remarked to the boys at the same time, "Now, that is one of the best barber shops that ever traveled with a show." </p>


            <p>It was under these conditions that the firm of Platt, Sponge &amp; Kelly was embarked upon the commercial world without a cent of indebtedness and an assured patronage of not less than $3.50 per week. No firm ever had a more brilliant future before it. Platt had fulfilled his part of the contract and all the rest had to be left to the honesty, industry and integrity of Sponge and Kelly. As all work had to be done on the basis of weekly payments, Sponge got up early Saturday morning and collected all of the money due the firm. He bought a pair of rubber boots and then proceeded to fill up on the rest of the firm's capital. The second week Kelly got the start of Sponge and collected the money and replenished his wardrobe before Sponge had turned out. As the firm went on you could always tell who collected the money. If it was Sponge he was drunk; if it was Kelly his wardrobe showed an elaborate expenditure of money. Platt, the capitalist, could never get an account, or a cent of returns. He tried in vain to get his investment back, but in show language he "was not in it."</p>

            <span class="tei_fw">120 BUFFALO BILL'S WILD WEST ROUTE BOOK SEASON OF 1896.</span>


            <p>Finally Sponge and Kelly fell out about the proceeds. Sponge had missed several weeks with his usual drunk, while Kelly's wardrobe had assumed mammoth proportions. He was living on easy street and persisted in keeping so. Under the new arrangements each one was to keep one razor and each alternate week the barber shears changed hands; they kept one towel each, the wheelbarrow was returned to the stake-and-chain wagon, and the firm proceeded as usual with its business.</p>

            <p>It was now that "Frog" Kelly, as he was known among us, showed originality in bookkeeping that was worthy a better cause and was never equalled in the history of the commercial world up to the present date. One afternoon in Portland, Me., I was coming past Kelly's shop when a canvasman had just got up from one of Kelly's operations. I noticed that he had three cuts on the side of his face and blood was running out of each one of them and dripping down on his clothes until he looked as if he had just come out of a slaughterhouse. After he had gone I asked "Frog" why he had cut the man so. He then informed me that it was the way he had of keeping tally. "Now, that


man owes me for three shaves; on pay-day I just look at his face and collect accordingly. It also protects my customers from Sponge; he keeps a book and his accounts are mixed all the time." The firm lived and prospered under the circumstances the remainder of the season. At Atlanta, Ga., on the last day, Sponge said to Kelly: "Now, 'Frog,' Platt has done what is right by us all summer, let us treat him white. We have one razor each and the shears; now, it will not be right for us to keep them all. A horse stepped on my razor last night and broke the handle and bent the shank; it is all right with those exceptions. Now, I propose to give Platt that razor, you keep the other one, and I will keep the shears. I think this will be an equal division and show him we are willing to divide on a fair basis, or equal division among all concerned."</p>

            <p>Thus ended the existence of the firm of Platt, Sponge &amp; Kelly, after a six months successful career. They closed as they started, not owing a cent; but, as usual with such great undertakings, the poor fellow who furnished the capital had to suffer</p>

            <h4>Owosso, Mich.</h4>
            <p>SATURDAY, August 1. Arrived in town at 6 A. M. One-mile haul to lot, which we found in bad condition and very uneven. Commenced to rain at 7.30 and poured down until 3.30 P. M., leaving the lot in a bad and muddy condition for the night's performance, also for the boys to pick up on, as it was another case of carry the stuff to the wagons on the street. Baskir Hadj Ali, one of the Arab boys who was left in Cleveland at the hospital sick, rejoined us to-day.</p>

            <h4>Ann Arbor, Mich.</h4>
            <p>SUNDAY, August 2. Arrived in town at 4.30 A. M. One and one-half mile haul to lot. All poles were painted and canvas repaired this morning, and we did not put up until night. There was a fishing party to-day composed of the following persons: Manager J. T. McCaddon, Treasurer Jule Keen, Charles and Fred Hutchinson, Press Agent Dexter W. Fellows and Usher J. W. Murray. They drove ten miles out to Wetmore Lake. Manager J. T. McCaddon took the prize by catching the only fish that was caught, which weighed four and one-half


pounds. J. Allen Darnaby, Ed Showles, Gerney Spaulding and Ed Aiken drove out to their rescue to help Mr. McCaddon in with his fish. The whole party returned to the cook house at 9.30 P. M. Josh Billings once said that he would not give a "cuss" for a man that could not tell a good fish story; could Josh have heard them the next day he would have bought the whole party. Alfred Vitelli and Phillip Recchia, of the Annex band, and victims of the Massillon bridge accident, returned from the Aultman Hospital at Canton, Ohio, and reported for duty.</p>

            <p>Weather clear and pleasant.</p>

            <p>MONDAY, August 3. We gave an hour and a quarter parade this morning on sandy roads in sultry weather. William Welton, superintendent of the baggage stock, left to-day for Carversville, Bucks County, Pa., for a two weeks rest to see if his health could not be improved a little. Manager J. T. McCaddon had his four and a half pound bass served for supper this evening; the fish cost $15.40, but it was worth it.</p>

            <p>Weather clear and fine.</p>

Coming in this morning flat car No. 122, containing the cook-house wagon, got a hot-box burned the journal off of the back truck. It broke eight miles from this place and it tore up the ties for 400 feet before the train was stopped. They had to send to Jackson for a new pair of trucks; it delayed us three and a half hours. Morris Doody, of the transportation department, was caught this morning by a stringer wagon coming down the runs and his right knee was badly sprained.</p>

There was a strike against the cook-house this evening; none of the dressing-room, soldiers, cowboys, band men or Indians went to supper. There was a council of war held behind the curtains, but the men would not go in. They claimed they were being fed poorly.</p>

            <p>SUNDAY, August 9. Arrived in town at 4.30 A. M. One-half mile haul to lot, which was very sandy and used as a dump pile. The weather was warm and the smell still warmer. We were all ready to put up canvas at 9 A. M. when a heavy wind and rain-storm came up. Orders were issued that no canvas should go up to-day. The "Fu-kort" Fishing Club was organized here, composed of the following members: Dexter W. Fellows, president, general contractor and path-finder; Jule Keen, treasurer; Fred B. Hutchinson, in charge of stock; John W. Murray, in charge of tackle; C. R. Hutchinson and J. T. McCaddon, just plain fishermen. Early this morning the above club started for Cascade Lake for a days fishing. In speaking of the trip Mr. Keen, treasurer, states as follows: "We had been informed by the natives that there was a tradition in ancient times some fish were seen near the lake (probably in some market woman's basket). A sight of a fish being caught was such a rare sight, that when Izaak Walton McCaddon (accidentally it is presumed) caught one the entire colony of summer boarders broke out in one spontaneous outburst of applause. Horns were blown, and even noses were treated likewise, in order to produce as much noise as possible over the

lucky member. Two carriage loads of people drove on the bridge overlooking the lake and bright smiles and waving handkerchiefs greeted the HERO of the day. Transportation-master Fred also captured one and was as much surprised as the victim was. Other fish to the number of two were caught by other members of the club after a quick and decisive battle." Lew Decker and his wife spent Sunday with his sister at Elk Rapids, Mich. Most every one else went to Reed's Lake, and Orator Col. J. J. McCarthy had a series of most appalling mishaps befall him. First he fell out of a boat into the lake; next a peanut vendor passed a lead dollar on him, which necessitated a seven-block walk to get a good dollar for the bad one; in the evening at the hotel he hung his clothes, which consisted of a nice new white vest that Mac had sprung that day, near the window; as it rained hard that evening Mac's clothes, vest and all, were soaked, but Mac didn't care. The cook-house strike was called off to day by concessions being made on both sides.</p>

            <p>Weather very warm and sultry with the exception of a short rain and wind-storm at 9 A. M.</p>

            <p>MONDAY, August 10. There was a heavy rain at 1 P.M. and it put the sand pile we had for a lot in better condition than we could with sprinklers and 


saved a lot of expense and horse flesh. There were two sections of reserves taken out this afternoon but the rush was so great that they had to be put back again. We had a hard time getting off to-night. Everything was to the hubs in sand, and in hauling all teams had to be doubled up.</p>

Bert Antes, an American soldier, fell back during parade, and while trying to catch up ran over a little boy and cut his right leg badly, and left several other bad bruises on his body. At 6.50 a wind-storm struck us and the canvas on the east side went down, and at 7.05 the west side came over into the arena, carrying electric light poles and lamps with it; both horse tents and dressing-room were let down, and in fifteen minutes the place looked like a wreck. Things were in a bad condition, and orders were given to pack, as no show would be attempted to-night. It was a hard pack up, and everything went backwards, and we did not get through much

M. a heavy rain came up that lasted two hours, and at the end of that time the lot was ready to join our long list of bad lots. More horses fell during the evening performance than at any other performance this season. August Beree and Herman Montery, French soldiers, received bad falls during the evening performance by their horses stepping into holes. Chief Loucas, of the Cossacks, had a bad fall to-night which resulted in the death of his horse, a beautiful animal, and a black eye to the chief. He had run into one of the bad places in the arena, and as he fell his horse's neck was broken. They carried the chief out, but as soon as he was in the dressing-room he came to and was all right, with the exception of a few bruises. The chief


mourns over the loss of his horse, for during the four years he has been with the Wild West, he and his horse have been inseparable. We had a long pull and a long haul to-night.</p>

During the bucking-horse act this afternoon, Col. Cody had his right arm caught in his lasso, and it was badly bruised and sprained, and it was with difficulty that he was able to do his shooting act. There were no street cars in this town, but that did not interfere with our business any, even if we were a great ways out.</p>

to recover them he fell from the wagon, striking his head on the paved street, fracturing his skull. He was immediately taken to a drug store near by, and from there to the hospital, where it was learned that his injuries were fatal. Nothing could be done for him but to try and relieve him of his pain, if he had any, for he never regained consciousness. Mrs. Schaffer and Mrs. Clarke, wives of "Schaffer and Clarke," of the Annex, came from Chicago to-day to remain during our engagement here. This evening the members of the band were invited to the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Lehfeldt, where they enjoyed a grand banquet. Mr. T. V. Murphy officiated as chairman for the occasion. Numerous songs recitations, etc., were indulged in, and at the table the "boys" proved themselves to be full-fledged men in doing justice to the grand spread which had been prepared for them. On motion, it was decided that Mr. G. T. Mitchell, one of the band members, should compose a march, and that it should be called "The Banquet March," and be respectfully dedicated to Mrs. Lehfeldt, with kindest regards of the band—said march to be played only by the Cowboy band. Many toasts were tendered the host and hostess, and all present wished the world was composed of many such whole-souled, big-hearted people as Mr. and Mrs. Lehfeldt have proven themselves to be. Besides the band, those present


were Mrs. Captain Lehfeldt,  Mr. Henry Lehfeldt, Miss Martha Lehfeldt, Mr. and Mrs. Haiser, Mr. and Mrs. Warner and Mrs. Clara Lehfeldt.</div>

            <p>MONDAY, August 24. This was an ideal show-day with an ideal business. We had the largest arena that the Wild West has showed in for four years. The house was full in the afternoon and a turn-away at night. Chief Usher McCune did himself proud to-night, as it was the best seated house of the season—not a vacant seat was to be found. John Curley, of the stake-and-chain wagon, who has been in the hospital at Chicago for the past week, returned to work to-day. A. C. Wilson was to-day appointed superintendent of the Annex canvas. Mrs. John Franz and Mrs. M. B. Bailey were guests to-day. Dan. Taylor returned this morning from Minneapolis and St. Paul, where he has been on business for the company.</p>

            <p>Weather clear and still.</p>

            <div class="p">TUESDAY, August 25. We had another serious accident to-day, but not fatal. Lewis Schilbe, who joined the show this morning as a driver, was injured at the runs this evening. His wagon struck a curbstone and he was thrown from his seat and severely injured. He was sent to his home in this city. Assistant chief of the Cowboys, Bill Brace, was thrown from his horse during the bucking-horse

            <p>WEDNESDAY, August 26. Arrived in town at 7.15 A. M., which was very early considering the long haul of last night, and a delay of forty minutes in a freight yard on account of a fire in a storage house near the track. Manager McCaddon, Fred Hutchinson, and J. W. Murray, of the "Fu-Kort" Fishing Club, went fishing after the afternoon show and returned with forty of the finest kind of lake bass. They all swore that they caught them, and as there was no proof to the contrary, it was declared around the camp to be the most successful fishing excursion of the season. Driver Edward Fletcher, who fell from his wagon in Milwaukee, died at three o'clock this afternoon at the Emergency Hospital.</p>

            <p>THURSDAY, August 27. Arrived in town at 4 A. M. Two-mile haul to lot. All flags were at half-mast to-day, and employees of the little horse tent wore crape on their hats out of respect for Edward Fletcher. Ed. Showles went to Milwaukee to look after his burial. He was embalmed, and the remains were taken from the Emergency Hospital to the Union Cemetery, Milwaukee. Edward Fletcher, known to us as "English," was born in Manchester, England, and was thirty-four years of age. He was employed for the past eight years with the Forepaugh Show and the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show, and no one had more friends or was more respected than "English." This is the second time death has visited our camp, and we sincerely hope we will not have to record another this season. Dave Watt, an old-time showman, but now a resident of this city, was a guest of the show to-day.</p>

We had a series of small things happen on our run to-night; among them was the falling of a brake-rod and a bad flat wheel, which delayed us so that we did not get into town until 6.30 A. M. One-mile haul to lot. Edward C. Wiebe, of the electric-light department, left to-day to join the Augustine Neuville Dramatic Company, at Louisville, Ky. John Curly left again to-night to go to the hospital in Milwaukee. James Rushenberger returned to-day from St. Luke's Hospital, Chicago. Indian Two Dog and wife closed to-day and left for Pine Ridge Agency to-night. M. Coyle, excursion agent and railroad manager, was with us to-day.

            <p>SUNDAY, August 30. We arrived in town at 4.30 A. M. This is the most beautiful place to Sunday in that we ever had, either this season or last. It is on a high bluff, overlooking the lake. The "Fu-kort" Fishing Club had another outing to-day, which proved to be the most successful one they ever had, they bringing back 147 lake perch. We all wish they would go every Sunday.</p>

            <p>MONDAY, August 31. We had to borrow hose from the city in order to sprinkle the arena, it was so sandy, and at night all wagons had to be hook-roped off the lot. At 4 P. M. over two thousand people stood on the bluff to see our Indians go in bathing in the lake. We had for supper some of the fish that the "Fu-kort" Club caught yesterday.</p>

            <h4>RUBBER-NECKS.</h4>

            <p>If you were to ask a resident of any place how many rubber-necks are in his town he would look surprised and answer, "I don't know what a rubber-neck is; I never saw one; I don't believe we have one in town."</p>

            <p>If you ask any old showman how many rubber-necks in any town that he has ever showed in he will tell you the exact number of them. If I were to make an estimate I would say that about twenty-five per cent. of the total population of all towns are affected with this disease. The worst feature about the complaint is that a man or woman may be afflicted so bad with this terrible disease that it has become chronic with them and they are not 


aware they are afflicted with it. The peculiarity of it consists in the strange manner in which it develops itself, the first symptoms of the disease being that a patient cannot sleep the morning the show arrives in town, so he gets up early and gets on the lot as soon as the first wagon is hauled on and stays until the last wagon leaves at night. His staying qualities are well developed. Another peculiarity of the disease is in his being able to stay so long and never spend a cent. The male rubber-neck comes early and stays late; the female rubber-neck comes just after the afternoon show and stays about two hours to look around a little; she is not near so persistent or as big a nuisance as her partner,

the male rubber-neck. The male will follow the stake gang until they go to breakfast, then stand outside the cook tent and look in and see them eat, as though they ate any different than any one else. Then when the doors are opened he will stand outside, size up the crowd, and remark that the show is taking all the money out of the town. He will follow the last wagon off the lot, see it loaded on the train, and go home completely cured of his disease until the next show comes to town, then he will suffer all the symptoms over again; he never misses a chance to rubber a show. There is one thing we like about him, and that is that we have a new one every day; this make him bearable, to a certain extent. When the showman curses his natural enemy and never misses a chance to make his life unpleasant, he is the most persistent rubber-neck we have to deal with.</p>

            <p>I have seen our own people go fifteen miles to rubber another show, and I have seen others come the same distance to rubber ours, and both parties go back and tell what a poor lot of stuff the other one has got. The showman knowing more about the business is the most uncharitable critic we have. He knows this, and takes advantage to make himself as big a nuisance as possible. It seems to be the established fact that we will have rubber-necks as long as shows exist, and of the two evils give us the least. Lord deliver us from the showman "rubber-neck."</p>

            <p>WEDNESDAY, September 2. Arrived in town at 5 A. M. One-quarter mile haul to lot, but the haul was a hard one, as all wagons had to be hook-roped on and off the lot. Louis Canier, a French soldier, closed to-day on account of ill-health. Capt. Jack O'Connor, of White Cloud, Mich., the deaf-mute marksman, was a guest of Miss Annie Oakley to-day. This has been one of the dismal days in show life—it rained all day and was very cold.</p>

            <h4>Centralia, Wis.</h4>
            <p>SATURDAY, September 5. Instead of waking up at Wausau, as we expected to do this morning, the first section was unceremoniously awakened at 3.30, forty-two miles from Wausau, between the stations of Centralia and Rudolph, and the second section was routed out at Centralia at 4.30 with the startling news that the first section had been wrecked. The second section left Stevens' Point according to programme at 10.45, was taken out to the junction of C., M. &amp; St. P. R. R. and side-tracked until the first section passed. As the first section was going up a grade between Centralia and Rudolph they stalled and cut the train in two, and started with one half of it for Rudolph station, and when the second section came along it was flagged, the conductor gave orders to the engineer to cut his engine loose and take the remaining cars of the first section up the grade to Rudolph, and they had hardly gotten under way when they met the engine of the first part of the first section coming back, and failing to either see or understand signals, they came together with a crash that was almost fatal to the rolling stock of the Wild West Company. Sleeping-cars, flat-cars and wagons all suffered alike—nothing escaped injury. Flat cars Nos. 105, 119, 124, 118 and 114 were left in the ditch as worthless.</p>


            <div class="p">Trunk wagon No. 84, side-pole wagon No. 18, canvas wagon No. 16, jack wagon No. 32, and side-show wagon No. 7 were abandoned. The buggies of Manager J. T. McCaddon, Superintendent Anderson, and the light express wagon were a total wreck, and their remains were left in the ditch with the other cars and wagons. It made a pile of wreckage that the oldest time Wild West man had never seen before. Sleeping-cars Nos. 56 and 151 were taken to the Minneapolis shops to be repaired, and sleepers Nos. 53 and 150 were taken to the LaCrosse shops for repairs. The occupants of car No. 150 had a very narrow escape, and that there was no loss of life was a wonder, as the car was almost entirely demolished. The occupants of the car were John McLaughlin, master of transportation, Jake Platt, superintendent of canvas, Ed. Lacey and Thomas McAvoy, and William Welton, superintendent of baggage stock, and assistant Eddie McLaughlin. No one was injured but Jake Platt, who received a badly sprained neck. The track was cleared at 1 P. M, and the first section, or what was then left of it, came back to Centralia, where the first section had laid from 3.30, where a council was held and the Wausau stand abandoned, and orders were issued to go to LaCrosse, Wis., our next stand. We left at 2.30 and arrived at La Crosse (after we had a lay over of four hours at

The first section had the cook-house wagon taken off and meals set for all, and at Centralia, all people from the second section, numbering about two hundred, were taken to the hotels and restaurants, horses were taken out, watered and fed, and were left out until orders were given to pull out. This is our first experience with a wreck in the two years we have been on the road, and we hope it will be the last.</div>

            <p>SUNDAY, Sept. 6. We arrived on the lot early this morning, and spent the whole morning looking for trouble and found lots of it, in the shape of damaged wagons, planks, seats, etc. The plank wagon we sent to the wagon shops here to be repaired this morning. Dan Taylor left his evening for Milwaukee to look after the repairs of our damaged cars and wagons. Nothing was put up to-day except horse and cook tents. Frank Butler and Annie Oakley went fishing to-day, but neither of them got a bite.</p>

            <p>WEDNESDAY, Sept. 9. Arrived in town at 7.30 A. M. One and one-half mile haul to lot, and most of the way in a bad, sandy road. The weather was most unfavorable to-day, cloudy and threatening all the morning, and in the afternoon it turned cold and a fine rain set in and it kept it up all night.

We only had a twelve-mile run last night, but we got in about our usual time; one engine brought the first section over and went back after the other one; it did not arrive until 6.15 A. M. One and one-half mile haul to lot and up hill both ways. It was cold and rained hard all the morning. Owing to the size of the town, bad weather, bad roads and a 154-mile run to-night, orders were issued at 9.30 A. M. that only one show would be given. George F. Mitchell, of the Cowboy Band, closed to-day. We were loaded and


ready to pull out at 7.45 P. M. As we were about one-half mile from town the train ran over a man, mangling his right foot. He gave his name a J. N. Mackey, of 890 Walnut street, Chicago, Ill. The train backed up and we left him at the depot.</p>

In getting parade out this morning, electric light wagon No. 1 got into a sink hole and it was 11.45 before it was taken out. Abe Laduke made a great hit in the bucking-horse act this afternoon; the first jump his horse made he was thrown on the horse's neck and he hung on and finished his act in this position, while the audience roared with applause. There were about 500 Chippewa Indians visited the show to-day at the afternoon performance. As soon as the performance was over they joined our Indians and held a pow wow and smoked the pipe of peace. This meeting was brought about by Col. W. F. Cody and Capt. W. A.

Chippewas. This is the first time in nearly forty years that these two old enemies have met on friendly terms. The first to speak was Chief Anakawad, of the Chippewas; he was followed by Chief Black Bird, Chief Neshogijig and Chief Buffalo. The Sioux were represented by Chief Rocky Bear, Chief Flat Iron, Poor Elk, Black Fox, Lone Bear, Bear Foot. Col. W. F. Cody and Capt. W. A. Mercer also made very appropriate speeches. The meeting was all that could be desired, and the "hatchet" is forever buried between these two tribes, who have been enemies for so many years.</div>

badly cut up and full of soft places and it was hard to work in it and very dangerous. Dr. Frank Powell (White Beaver) was again a guest of the show to-day. Dr. Chauncey Watson, of Colorado, presented Cowboy Jack Venoy with a fine silver cup this afternoon for good horsemanship. Joseph Mayer, proprietor of the Official Programme, paid us a visit to-day. Weather bad again to-day, cold northwest rain all the morning, but it cleared up a little at night. This closes our two-day stands, and I think the working force are glad of it.

            <p>SUNDAY, September 20. Arrived in town at 5.30 A. M. Three-mile haul to lot and  all across country roads. We were never so far from town or car service as we will be here. The street-car system consists of three miles of mule railroad with one car, consequently the trips average one an hour, and it does not run within one mile of the Fair Grounds, where we are located. Manager J. T. McCaddon, Fred Hutchinson, Annie Oakley, Frank Butler and William Sweeney went hunting to-day and came back with one prairie chicken, one jack rabbit and a duck. Big-top was not put up to-day.</p>

            <p>Weather clear and cool and very windy. We found one-half inch ice this morning.</p>

BUFFALO BILL'S WILD WEST ROUTE BOOK SEASON OF 1896.</span>


            <p>MONDAY, September 21. We are having bad show weather to-day; it tried to snow all morning but cleared off a little this afternoon. We gave a long parade this morning and a lonesome one it was; about one and one-half miles before we got into the city limits. As this was the opening day of the Fair the grounds were thrown open to the public free for the benefit of the show. The Annex opened to a twenty-five cent admission and a very good business this morning. Dr. Carver was a guest of the show this evening.</p>

            <p>Business big in the afternoon, light at night.</p>

            <p>Weather cloudy and threatening.</p>

            <p>TUESDAY, September 22. We came into town in three sections last night, last section arriving at 7.15 A. M. One-half mile haul to lot, which was small, and we were much crowded for room. The parade was long and over the roughest kind of streets. Dan Taylor went to Omaha last evening and returned to night.</p>


            <p>There is the toughest kind of times in this town, but business was good at both performances.</p>

            <p>Weather fine.</p>

            <p>Lot, Fourth and Missouri streets.</p>

            <p>WEDNESDAY, September 23. Arrived in town at 4 A. M. One-half mile haul to lot. This is the most ideal lot we have been on this season. Plenty of room and convenient to town, which makes it desirable, as there is no street car system. Manager J. T. McCaddon and Fred Hutchinson went hunting again this afternoon and came back with one rabbit. You must not get this rabbit mixed with the one they got at Sioux Falls; it is another rabbit altogether.</p>

            <p>Business big in the afternoon but light at night.</p>

lengths of blue seats were put up to-day and that was none too many, as every seat was taken and many had to stand up or sit on the grass. A hunting party this afternoon again was organized with the usual results, one jack rabbit and a few pigeons, and the whole party came very near getting left seven miles out in the country, as they lost the wagon that took them out. Weather was unfavorable again to-day; cold northwest wind with rain in the morning. Third Assistant Superintendent of Canvas Thomas McAvoy was kicked badly by one of the horses to-night.</p>

            <h4>"THE OLD GUARD."</h4>
            <p>Buffalo Bill's Wild West, unlike any other amusement exhibition, was an original creation, its component parts and acts having been launched together as a whole, a satisfactory, unique affair. As such it has attracted the attention of the amusement world, commanded the favor of the public and marked a new history in the era of horsemanship, ethnology and historic accuracy of pictures presented, feats accomplished and genuineness of the characters participating. As time rolls on and the future chroniclers of our day record their annals of events, its birth, production, evolution, travels and the incidents of its career will assume an interest far beyond that which the casual observer of the present would suspect. Like the treasured histories and traditions of the drama, la cirque, the opera and vaudeville of the past becomes subject of the pen, so will come the transcript of "America's National Entertainment," a matter of interest as regards the originators, the cast of character and the associates connected with its baptism.</p>


            <p>Originating in the brain of W. F. Cody (Buffalo Bill), its conception was inspired and its development aided by the romantic surroundings of actual scenes connected with the subject, incident to his career from boyhood to his development as a picturesque leading character in the story it portrayed. To him belongs the credit of thus presenting to the world for the first time an exhibition that in fact truthfully and actually "holds the mirror up to nature." Due credit must also be given to his confrere, Mr. Nate Salsbury, in its management and evolution until it embraced and justly earned the sub-title "Congress of the Rough Riders of the World."</p>

            <p>After contemplating for years the feasibilities of presenting in reality the historic scenes and incidents heretofore depending on the pen of the historian, the reports of the army officials, the brush of the painter, the skill of the sculptor, the imagination of the romancer and novelist, Buffalo Bill, at the celebration of our natal day, Fourth of July

1882, gathered experimentally a corps of Western experts with their red allies, the American Indian, at North Platte, Neb., and on the very ground famed as disputed territory between the contending Indians and the white advance guard of civilization, proved its presentation a practical accomplishment. The genuineness of the pictures delineated demanded the possession of rare physical powers, agility, courage, expertness and endurance beyond any exhibition ever organized. To him, personally, must be conceded the laurel crown of supremacy for a continual physical, as well as mental, strain, in the conduct of the performances given with but little interruption, twice a day for nearly fourteen years—a record unbroken and unequaled for personal exertion, remarkable energy, activity and strain in physical endurance, unexcelled, rendering him entitled to and deserving the oft-applied title of "Modern Gladiator."</p>

            <p>It is on record that he has never in sunshine, rain, even snow and hail, missed a performance, in which, besides his personal participation, he is necessitated to be constantly alert in directing.</p>

            <p>In the fourteen years, the roster of the company embraces over five thousand names, he alone standing forth as the only present participant in the first arenic display. And in connection with its first production in continuous service from its incipient


organization in a camp located at Columbus, Neb., in the spring of 1883, and the first performance at Omaha, in May, 1883, there remains but Jule Keen, Johnny Baker, and Major John M. Burke of the original members, forming with Col. Cody what is now known as the "Old Guard." These well-known companions of its tours and followers of its fortunes in continuous service have continued during this season ably to fulfill the requirements of their positions. Their records include all the tours in American and Europe, and all have been noted for the uninterrupted attention to the requirements and duties entailed on them. The Old Guard are highly thought of and much respected by their associates and of their especial adaptation in their particular lines, and had the opportunity on one occasion of being appropriately photographed on the famed hill of Waterloo, where was the splendid exhibition of devotion to cause and duty that rendered forever memorable Napoleon's Old Guard.</p>

            <p>Death has claimed many of the participants of this organization, noticeably Major Frank North, Capt. Fred Matthews, Capt. George Clothier, noted Indian fighters; and the celebrated Indian chiefs, Black Bird, Crow Eagle, Spotted Horn Bull, the celebrated Sitting Bull, who loaned their historic careers to the accuracy and legitimacy of this interesting and educational affair.</p>

            <p>An object of international interest has been the Deadwood Stage Coach, now the most celebrated in the history of the world. Built in 1863, at Concord, N. H., it voyaged in the clipper ship <span class="italic">General Grant</span> around Cape Horn to California, where it ran on the line from Northwood to Oregon, drifted back to Utah, following the building of the lines of the Central Pacific across the Rocky Mountains until the conjoining of that road with the Union Pacific, and then became famous in 1876 on the lines between Cheyenne and Deadwood. Its sanguinary history as passenger and treasure coach would fill volumes. It has accompanied the exhibition on all its tours; has been an object of interest at Rotten Row, London; Champs Elysee, Bois de Boulogne, Paris; the Corso in Rome; the Boulevards of Naples; the Ramblier, Barcelona; the Prata, Vienna; Unter den Linden, Berlin; the Drive, Brussels, and other leading cities. It has carried more distinguished passengers that any vehicle known to the world's history—more presidents, queens, princes and princesses—royalty of fact, and royalty of brain—than ever did or ever can possibly honor by their presence any similar equipage. In the course of time its history and its presence will be a valued relic in the Smithsonian Institute, at Washington, D. C.</p>

            <p>Another episode in the career of the Wild West was its inauguration of the Coliseum, Chicago, which was appropriately opened with a grand ovation equalling the famous patronage extended it the season of the World's Fair. This building is the largest of its kind in the world, and is built on exactly the same ground where was the camp and arena of Buffalo Bill's Rough Riders of the World during the Columbian Exposition. This adds another location to the many that have become permanent and have since become devoted to amusements that this company had dedicated to the public of different nations, notably Earls Court, London; the Buffaloville Athletic Grounds, Paris; the Kofferdam Strasse Spiel Platz, Berlin; the Corso Americano, Barcelona; and many others that will probably remain as permanent monuments of the American Scout, Col. W. F. Cody (Buffalo Bill).</p>

            <h4>THE ADVANCE</h4>


            <p>"Buffalo Bill's men are in town to-day, puttin' up Bill's bills," is the gag that has been heard thousands of times this season. This excruciatingly funny joke—in the minds of the jays who spring it—is the best idea the public has of the advance. No doubt there are many with the show whose ideas are just about as clear. For the benefit of those a sentence will be devoted to telling them that it is the advance which makes all the necessary preparations for the show to go into a town and find lots, licenses, provisions and people all ready and waiting for it. Not only is this so, but the management is supplied with reports so itemized, that it knows the location and cost of putting up every sheet of paper used to advertise, and knows the individual bill-poster, lithographer and programmer who did it.</p>


            <p>The personnel of the advance is its most important feature. The art preservative is so far advanced that any one can get fine paper if he has the price. But money cannot always buy men and loyalty. This is particularly true, if it may be said modestly, of the advance of Buffalo Bill's Wild West. Perhaps the best comment that can be made of the advance is this: to a man every agent who was in advance in '95 was re-engaged for '96. But one proved faithless to his trust, a poor wretch, who sacrificed friends and honor to the worship of liquor and cards, and defrauded his generous employers of money. This is particularly painful, as it is the first instance in years of that sort of thing happening among the men who make up the advance.</p>

            <p>The major-general of the advance was Mr. W. H. Gardner. For more than twenty years he filled

               <span class="tei_fw">270 BUFFALO BILL'S WILD WEST ROUTE BOOK SEASON OF 1896.</span>


the same position for the Barnum &amp; Bailey Show. It goes without saying that his ripe experience, cool judgment, and indefatigable industry has been the inspiration of the entire advance. If he had any fault it was that he worked too hard and risked his health and services to the show; if he erred it was in kindness.</p>

            <p>Major John M. Burke, General Manager, is also claimed by the advance. The Major is the major, unique, solitary, the only one of his kind. His huge form, all two small for his heart, casts as welcome a shadow as ever fell across the threshold of an editorial room. It is not fulsome adulation to say that the newspapers only honor themselves in honoring Major Burke, and they, knowing it, inevitably place their columns at his command.
 Reminiscence, history, anecdote, story, fall from his lips in as graceful stream as ever water flowed from a fountain, and they are eagerly caught up by the editors, and repeated in print in a generous and genuine effort to let their readers share in the "feast of reason and flow of soul." John Burke can neither be considered or written of as an ordinary man, and the writer, as one member of a harmonious advance, feels all too keenly the poverty of his pen, when he attempts to set down the pride and pleasure of himself and all the others, in being classed in the same company with Major Burke.</p>


            <p>The Hon. Michael Cassius Coyle was at the head of the transportation department. He is chiefly loved for the enemies he does not make. He has not one on earth.</p>

            <p>Whiting Allen continued to spend the show's money with the newspapers, and occasionally found one that would print something he had to say about the show.</p>

            <p>What shall be said of that simple-minded, sweet-souled general contracting agent, Solomon Herod Semon, "the youngest agent in the business"? The manner in which "Old Si" went around paying exorbitant sums for lots, licenses and bill-boards at Si-ox City, Dub-u-que and all "them other towns" was "simply heart rendering," as the jay said when his best girl shook him. Seriously, he earned the gratitude of the entire advance for putting them up in the finest line of swell hotels any advance ever enjoyed.</p>

            <p>Mr. H. H. Gunning was manager of Car No. I. The very strictest of disciplinarians, even-tempered and just, he played no small part in making this show as well billed as any show on earth. But what a sight Col. Heatherstone Hurlingham was when he went flying through every town upon his Columbia wheel! Winged-feet Mercury was enraged with jealousy—not of his lack of veracity, but of his speed and omnipresence.</p>

            <p>To Mr. George Goodheart, manager of Car No. 2, was entrusted the important task of working up the excursions. That his work was well done need not be said. He is thinking about entering the lists for the championship of the world as a trick bicycle rider—nit.</p>

            <p>If there is one car agent more than another who is less welcome to the opposition, it is Fred Beckman, manager of Car No. 3. There was no calliope upon the car; it was only Fred's shirts.</p>

            <p>Mr. Bert J. Conn, well known in Holland as the Count of Geldermalsen, and Mr. J. Fred LeCrone, were the Argus-eyed gentlemen who saw to it that work was done as reported in the country, and paper kept in place in the windows of the towns.</p>
 

            <p>Harry Barnum, the Duke of Johannesburg, took his sackful of Kohinoors into every city and proceeded to lay out the town. Laymen must not suppose he abused anyone. "Laying-out" is a term that is purely technical in this business.</p>

            <p>There is no calling in which a greater degree of harder manual labor and intelligence are necessarily combined than bill-posting ahead of such a show as this. In the Buffalo Bill roster there were many of the acknowledged cracker-jacks and record-holders. There is not enough space to name them, but a route book would be incomplete that did not mention the veteran George Hurst, who completed


his thirtieth consecutive year, the last sixteen of which have been spent in the same car, in one corner of which has been his couch during all those years. Pete Dunn is another veteran who should be named. "Manager" George Beckley has earned a proud record for hard and intelligent work. Chas. Moralles, a veteran and literateur, M. G. Fisher, "Cyclone" Arthur McCloud, Al Foss. George E. Rice, Knapp, and Boss Bill Posters Tom Brown, Chas. Knox and Tommy Morgan-who-played-the-organ, are all men of whom only best things may be said. The names of the others may be found in the rosters of their respective cars.</p>

            <p>With a force so thoroughly organized and made up of such steady, reliable men, work proceeded with a regularity that was well-nigh tranquil. Probably no other show met with so little close opposition. One concern with the boldness and recklessness of youth ventured into the territory of this show. They had been badly whipped last season, but it was "not in our own country." This season it was in "their country." They tried it only twice and to their sorrow. They started out to "spank" other people and the spanking has yet to be done.</p>

            <p>The glorious Fourth was celebrated at Toledo by Car No. I. "Papa" J. E. Allien, representing the publishers of the official programme, is nothing if

not patriotic, and to him must be given credit for making the celebration a noisy and enthusiastic success. A very large supply of fireworks were secured, and taken to the car which was stationed at the end of the Cherry street bridge, opposite the main part of the city, and in full view therefrom. The car was most elaborately decorated. The public had been duly notified through the press of the boys' intention, and evening found the car surrounded by nearly two thousand persons, while from the bridge and other points of vantage several thousands more could see the pyrotechnic display. Several special policemen were sent to preserve order and the evening passed off with great <span class="italic">eclat.</span> A balloon thirty feet high was among the pieces sent up, and it carried dates and small printing that was released at a vast altitude to carry back to earth the glad tidings that Buffalo Bill was coming. This celebration may or may not have done something to making Toledo one of the banner days of the season for the show.</p>


            <p>Accidents and other misfortunes were very infrequent. There were no fatalities until the No. I car reached Joliet. Six two-horse teams went out on one of those days when the grim destroyer came in the form of heat. Six of the poor horses fell to rise no more.</p>

            <p>The nearest approach to a calamity was when Frank Archer, secretary and typewriter of Car No. I, went to see his girl at Yankton, and she tried to get him to stop off there and marry her. But Frank was brave, and did not yield to the allurement, and the next morning was back at work as if nothing had happened.</p>

            <p>There may be nothing very startling in this chapter devoted to the advance. But it is not intended as an exhaustive chronicle of events; rather is it the register of simply a part, albeit an important one, of the machinery that served to bring to the very doors of the people of America, in all its international glory, Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World.</p>

               <p>Blow downs—at Oswego, N. Y., August 6th, 2.30 P. M., a wind-storm blew down both horse tents and dressing room, and the west side of the grand stand; several people injured, but none fatally. Railroad accident coming into Biddeford, Maine, Sunday, July 15th—axle broke under stock car and delayed first section two hours. At Akron, Ohio, Tuesday, August 27th, the car containing cook-house wagons was smashed in switching; wagons transferred and got through next day at noon. Tuesday, August 13th, while coming to the train at night the emigrant wagon was struck by a train, and both mules were killed. At Schenectady, N. Y., in bringing the stock to the train, a buffalo cow got into the canal and was drowned. Our accidents and losses were remarkably small, taken from a business standpoint, and the season was all that could be expected. There were only two weeks that might be considered bad ones, the week in North Carolina and the closing week in Atlanta, Ga. The management has every reason to feel proud of the Buffalo Bill Wild West Company, as a business enterprise for the season of 1895.</p>

               <span class="tei_lg">
                  <span class="tei_l">The question has been often asked, and it's one I would like to know,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Is where do showmen come from, and where do showmen go?</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">I have asked old men this question, men who have been at it all their lives;</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">They will scratch their heads awhile and look a little wise.</span>
               </span>

               <span class="tei_lg">
                  <span class="tei_l">As the season gets close to the end, a way long in the fall,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">The boys will get their things together— the bundle is always small. </span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Each one of them picks up his own things, that is all of them he knows;</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">The reason why the bundle is small is because he has no clothes.</span>
               </span>


               <span class="tei_lg">
                  <span class="tei_l">When the last day comes and we are all packed up and done,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">They pick up their little bundle and go out one by one;</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">They never stop to say "Good-by," or "We have had a pleasant year"—</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Just pick up their little bundle and quietly disappear.</span>
               </span>

               <span class="tei_lg">
                  <span class="tei_l">When you are through yourself and ready to take the train for home,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">You look around for company and find they all have gone;</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">And so they start off quietly—they always go alone, </span>
                  <span class="tei_l">You can't tell where they have gone for they never had a home.</span>

               <span class="tei_lg">
                  <span class="tei_l">One or two go South—they do this every fall—</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Some stay right in the town and never leave at all;</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">And so the boys get scattered—get scattered here and there—</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">No one seems to know where, and no one seems to care. </span>
               </span>

               <span class="tei_lg">
                  <span class="tei_l">The season soon rolls around again and there is lots of work to do,</span>

                  <span class="tei_l">Before the show goes out again the work must all be done, </span>
                  <span class="tei_l">It is now the boys show up again—they drop in one by one.</span>

                  <span class="tei_l">And as they drop in day by day you are glad to see them all,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">They have got their little bundles, the ones they had last fall.</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">Where they have been and what they have done no one seems to know, </span>
                  <span class="tei_l">I think they are like the ground-hog, with the season come and go.</span>

               <span class="tei_lg">
                  <span class="tei_l">I have traveled with a show myself for many a weary year, </span>
                  <span class="tei_l">And this is one of the things I never knew or never will I fear.</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">I wish some prophet would rise up, for some one ought to know,</span>
                  <span class="tei_l">It is where do showmen come from, and where do showmen go?</span>
