   <div class="note">Note 3: Laban Hillberry (variant spelling 'Labin Hillsberry'), a prospector who was looking for investors in a water development project in the Big Horn Basin in 1893 when he met George Beck; Hillberry described to Beck the potential for diverting water from the South Fork of the "Stinking Water" (Shoshone River) to irrigate the area. Beck then sent Jerry Ryan to evaluate the country for him; Ryan's report encouraged Beck to seriously consider the area.</div>
