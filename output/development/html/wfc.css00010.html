<span class="tei_salute">My Dear Major,</span>

      </span>

      <p>The Indians with me want a favor. And as they have been such good men I hope you will grant it.</p>

      <p>They have been saving and bought a great many useful things to take home. But they are shy a <span class="unclear ">bunch[?]</span> and it breaks an Indians heart to go home without a trunk.</p>

      <p>They would like to have $10 each the $25 a month men. The Chiefs $15 each. This to be taken from their last month and back pay that is to be paid them in your presence.</p>

      <p>Hope you will grant their request.</p>

      <span class="tei_closer">
         <span class="tei_salute">Very faithfully yours</span>
         <span class="tei_signed">W. F. Cody</span>
