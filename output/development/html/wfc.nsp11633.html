      <p>THE period during which Buffalo Bill's Wild West Exhibition was originally intended to remain in Glasgow has now elapsed, and to signalise the commencement of the second portion of his stay, Colonel Cody has introduced the warlike performances of the representatives of the Shulis tribe of Africans. Although they have only been accustomed to perform for a comparatively brief time, it must be said that they conduct themselves very well, and seem to have become familiar with their surroundings in the "Wild West." Along with the natives of the American and African continents a troupe of trained Burmese elephants are shown. Their performance is a most remarkable one, and is certainly the best which has been seen in Glasgow.</p>
