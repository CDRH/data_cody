that statement you have more <span class="underline">Foreman</span> than working men. Heck is drawing pay for Foreman And we can play no favorites. In this fight of hours if he cant get up and attend to business He will have to be let out. <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Don't​">Dont</a> keep a man you <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="don't​">dont</a> need. We must make a showing when these men get there or our gig is up—</div>

      <p>Now George— make every man jump to his work— <span class="underline">&amp; stick to it. have you ordered the lumber for headgate</span>? </p>
