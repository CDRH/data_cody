   <div class="note">Note 1: Although Cody did not include the year in the dateline of this letter, it was probably written in 1915. Cody performed with the Sells-Floto Circus in San Diego from April 15 through April 17, 1915.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: "Clarence" is believed to be <span class="persName"/>Clarence W. Rowley, a prominent Boston attorney and friend of Cody.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 3: Perhaps Cody meant Hannibal, Missouri. He performed there on at least three occasions in his show-business career, including August 20, 1898; September 29, 1911; and September 26, 1914.</div>
