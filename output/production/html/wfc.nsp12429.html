      <div class="tei_p p">THE Horticultural Exhibition at Earl's Court has undoubtedly caught on, and within a month after the opening the number of visitors has exceeded half a million. It is not only the beauty of the grounds and the strains of the various excellent bands, but also the interesting series of exhibits in the main building, that attracts visitors in crowds—to say nothing of the "Wild West," or "Buffalo Bill" with his Indians, his Cowboys, his Cossacks, his Gauchos, and his marksmen, prominent among whom is <a href="../item/wfc.person#oakley.a">Annie Oakley</a>, "Little Sure-shot."
