      <p class="tei_p">THE boys and girls of the Licensed Victuallers' Schools, to the number of 250, accompanied by their teachers and their boys' band, spent an afternoon at the Horticultural Exhibition, marching through the building and playing their band until they arrived at Buffalo Bill's Wild West. Here seats were placed at their disposal in the grand stand, where they witnessed and thoroughly enjoyed every item of the performances, from the cowboys' band overture to the attack on the settler's cabin. The roar of small voices and clapping of hands when Colonel Cody, on his white charger, first appeared was something to be remembered. The performances over, the whole party, together with their grown-up friends, were photographed in a group inside the arena, the camera "taking in" Buffalo Bill on horseback and five or six Indian chiefs in their full war paint. The little ones were then regaled with unlimited tea, cake, and fruit at Messrs. Bertram's restaurant, and from there they went to the western gardens to listen to the band of the Belgian "Guides," see the side shows, the switchback railway, and everything else worth looking at.</p>
