      <h3>New Exhibition<br/>
AT<br/>
Earl's Court.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">THE Duke of Connaught opened the Horticultural Exhibtion at Earl's Court on Saturday, and judging from the many and varied, attractions offered, which by no means confine themselves to horticulture proper, it promises to be a very successful show. The management has evidently not wished to have a beautiful floral display merely, for the central avenue is devoted to horticultural appliances of many kinds, and the various systems of glazing, heating, and ventilation are to be shown; also model plant houses, implements, garden seats and requisites, fuel, weed killers, peats of different sorts, fertilisers, the newest inventions, pumps, perfumes, machinery for cleaning seed, and last, a most interesting and valuable addition, namely, "Designs for the laying out of a typical estate of one hundred acres, bounded by roads, five miles from town in the Midlands, with grounds sloping gradually towards the water, and designs for improvement of grounds to private residences, photographs of trees and shrubs."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Among the popular attractions of the Exhibition may be mentioned Buffalo Bill's performance, which is bound to find a numerous audience whenever people are bent upon a day's enjoyment and have "done" the horticultural portion of the show; a switchback railway, and a theatre. The approach from Earl's Court station is being suitably adorned, and will prove a pretty entrance when finished.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">THE love which woman has for all domestic animals manifests itself in various ways. Nothing, I contend, gives more unalloyed pleasure to a woman endowed with an appreciation for the surroundings of a country life than a show of beautiful horses. "Buffalo Bill's" stables are quite as popular a portion of the show as any other, and there are no keener judges of the horseflesh there to be seen than the lady visitors. But woman goes further than remaining a mere spectator, and frequently appears on the scene as a breeder and exhibitor.</p>
