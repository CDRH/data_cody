      <div class="note">Black Fox (Joe Black Fox), or <span class="italic">Strigi-La-Sapa</span> (c1844-c1928), was an Oglala Lakota who joined Buffalo Bill's Wild West in 1889. He was nephew to Sitting Bull and cousin to Crazy Horse. In 1890 Black Fox was one who testified to the United States Commissioner of Indian Affairs, strongly defending Cody's treatment of the Indian performers.  In 1898 Black Fox and other Lakota were photographed by Gertrude KÃ¤sebier in her New York studio. Black Fox left Buffalo Bill's Wild West in 1907 and is alleged to have died blind and destitute at Pine Ridge circa 1928.</div>
