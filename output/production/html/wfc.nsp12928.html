      <h3>The Queen and Buffalo Bill.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">Let us hope that Buffalo Bill will amuse the <a href="../item/wfc.person#victoria.q">Queen</a>, since he has obtained the honour of a command to appear at Windsor.  Her Majesty is certainly very ready lately to see all things theatrical and sportive that are to be seen, and Buffalo Bill will be by no means the least interesting personage who has given his show in the Castle grounds. In this connection it is curious to remember that the Queen was very desirous last year to see a bicycle race, and very nearly organised one through the National Cyclists' Union. They say that she yet means to see bicyclists at their best, and that the wheelmen may have a chance later this year. Meanwhile Colonel Cody is putting up his tents and schooling his chiefs to their duty. It would be a sad mishap if one of them imitated the Shah of Persia, and offered to add Princess Beatrice to his wigwam.</p>
