      <h3>LAST OF A BRAVE.</h3>
      <h3>The Remains of Kill-His-Pony Shipped to His Father in Dakota.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">The body of the young Sioux Indian, <a href="../item/wfc.person#otakte">Kill-His-Pony</a>, who died last week at Bellevue Hospital, was shipped to Pine Ridge Agency at midnight Saturday.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The body was in charge of scout Jack Clifford, who was engaged by <a href="../item/wfc.person#obeirne.j">General O'Beirne</a> to see that the remains of the young brave were safely delivered to his father, the chief Corn Planter, in Dakota.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">On the coffin lay a wreath of ivy, the gift of <a href="../item/wfc.person#crager.g">Mr. Creigan</a>, who has spent twenty years among the Sioux, and is well acquainted with old Corn Planter.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Those who acted as pall-bearers to the train were General O'Beirne, who is an old Indian fighter, and who has an Indian name a foot long; <a href="../item/wfc.person#craft.f">Father Croft</a>, who has been a missionary among the Sioux Indians, and a chief of the tribe to which Kill-His-Pony belonged; Captain McGee and Jack Clifford, two scouts and Indian fighters; Mr. Creigan and W. Barkay.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The expense of embalming the body of Kill-His-Pony, and of shipping it home, is borne by Buffalo Bill, as it was while with the Wild West Show in Europe that the Indian received the injuries from which he died. </p>
