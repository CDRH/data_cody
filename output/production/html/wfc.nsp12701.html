      <p class="tei_p">The Wild West at Earl's Court.—Col. Cody has now got together an assemblage of rough-riders from all parts of the world, so that every variety of mounting, and sticking on a horse can be studied with advantage. Cavalrymen will be interested in noting the gradual development in mastering the wildest and roughest animals, and a good many hints can be picked up by the British soldier, who may be required in a remote part of the world to take to some very raw material in the way of horseflesh. The realistic drama of the escaped soldier from the United States Army who takes to horse-stealing and meets with a short shrift, and the vivid presentment of the way the Indians treat their prisoners, complete this cosmorama of the new world, which increases in interest as the season goes on.</p>
