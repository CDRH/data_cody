            <h3>SLOPER'S NEW FRIENDS.</h3>
            <p class="tei_p">"Since Buffalo Bill has returned to London with his Wild West Show, Poor Pa's visits there have been frequent. Consequently, he has become acquainted with numerous celebrated personages. Papa is naturally unselfish, and with heart bubbling over with happiness at the thought of the pleasure he should impart, he playfully remarked to Tottie and Lardi that, if they would meet him in Regent Street at a certain time on a certain morning, he would introduce them to two gentlemen of eminence. The girls kept the appointment, and almost died with fright. Papa should be more careful in his choice of friends."—TOOTSIE</p>
