      <h3>WEEKLY LONDON LETTER.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">The International Horticultural Exhibition, which opens at Earl's Court on May 7th, bids fair to be successful. The preparations are well advanced, as I found when taking a private view of the grounds and buildings the other day. It is expected that the gardens will display a profusion of flowers and plants from all parts of the world, effectively grouped, and a sup-tropical garden will certainly attract attention, as will also the examples of the gardens of all ages. Flower and fruit shows, flower fêtes, and lectures and demonstrations in gardening will form part of the arrangements, and the buildings will contain exhibits of everything connected with the previous exhibitions at Earl's Court, is, I hear, one of the prime movers (and no doubt financiers), and the entire profits are to be devoted to such gardening institutions as the executive committee may select.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The arena adjoining the exhibition grounds, which last year formed the scene of German military evolutions, will once more re-echo the whoop of Buffalo Bill's "Wild West" Indians and cowboys, and the redoubtable Colonel Cody and Annie Oakley, the crack woman rifle-shot, will, after five years' absence from London, again display their prowess with rifle and revolver. The scenery surrounding the arena has been painted by Mr. Glover, of Glasgow, and is an admirable piece of work, quite in keeping with the western scenes to be enacted. Jovial Major <a href="../item/wfc.person#burke.j">John Burke</a>, Buffalo Bill's right hand man, is once more installed in his log cabin ("our ranch"), and he tells me that their Indians are as representatives a collection as may be found anywhere. There will, of course, be much curiosity to look upon the faces of chiefs who took part in the Indian uprising at Pine Ridge and the battle of Wounded Knee Creek, among whom is "Kicking Bear," the fighting chief of the Sioux ghost-dancers.</p>
