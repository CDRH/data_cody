      <p class="tei_p">The Grand Stand at Buffalo Bill's "Wild West" was nearly half-filled yesterday afternoon with children, to the number of 1265, belonging to the schools of St. Albans and to many other schools in the neighbouring towns and villages. Miss Bingham, of St. Albans, was the organiser of the festivities, and it was at her expense that the children had this treat. Each child and teacher was presented with a new three-penny piece in commemoration of the event.</p>
