         <a name="n02.note"> </a>Note 2: The Maxwell Grant, which takes its name from Lucien B. Maxwell (1818-1875), the son-in-law of one of the original grant holders, became one of the largest private land holdings in the United States, covering over 1.7 million acres in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico. The tangled legal history of this tract begins in 1841, when the local Mexican governor issued the original grant to Maxwell's father-in-law Carlos Beaubien and his partner Guadelupe Miranda. The precise limits of the Mexican grant were the subject of much litigation until the Supreme Court decided the case in 1887. By then, Maxwell's claims were owned by the Maxwell Land Grant Company, which was under the control of Dutch investors. Martinus Petrus Pels (c. 1837-1906), a representative of the Dutch investors, served as general manager of the Maxwell Land Grant Company from 1888 to 1894.  Cody's attempt to persuade Pels to invest in the <a href="../item/wfc.encyc#">Cody-Salsbury Canal</a> did not succeed.  <a href="#n02.ref"> [back] </a>

         <a name="n03.note"> </a>Note 3: William F. Cody refers to Heart Mountain, whose summit is about ten miles northwest of Cody, Wyoming.  The river mentioned here is the Shoshone River, which was to be the water source for the Cody-Salsbury Canal. <a href="#n03.ref"> [back] </a>

         <a name="n04.note"> </a>Note 4: The governor of Wyoming was then DeForest Richards (1846-1903). The "Board" Cody mentions is the Wyoming Board of Land Commissioners, which consisted of the state's governor, secretary of state, and superintendent of public instruction. The board supervised Carey Act irrigation projects in the state, in cooperation with the state engineer. Fred Bond (1856-1903) was then the state engineer. <a href="#n04.ref"> [back] </a>

         <a name="n06.note"> </a>Note 6: The Irish-born Michael R. Russell (1847-1930) met William F. Cody in Kansas during the 1860s, and the two men formed a lasting friendship. Russell moved to Deadwood, South Dakota, in 1877 and took up business interests that included saloonkeeping and mining operations. About 1895, Russell sold Cody a herd of horses and the "TE" brand, which Cody used to establish his TE Ranch on the South Fork of the Shoshone River southwest of Cody, Wyoming. <a href="#n06.ref"> [back] </a>
