up all night long without water. If this is so— there is not words strong enough in any language to express my feelings— And if I find out that this is true Some one will be called down and left out for it. Any man who cruelly treats a dumb brute Is not fit to live. <a href="../item/wfc.person#grouard.f">Frank Grouard</a> has my stock in charge and what he says about them goes— There will be some rapid changes <span class="tei_add">if</span> I <span class="tei_del">f</span>  find my poor dumb brutes are being cruelly treated

To-day the weather cleared up a little and gave one good day, consequently good business; every chair in the house was sold at 7.30. Col. Cody's horse fell this afternoon and caught his foot, but did him no injury. Cowboys Bill Brace and Bob Wilkinson were thrown to-night in the bucking-horse act. The Order of the Mystic Shrine came out in a body to see us to-night." <a href="#n01.ref"> [back] </a>
