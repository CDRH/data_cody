         <a name="n01.note"> </a>Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Muskegon, Michigan, on August 11, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "Muskegon, Mich. / Tuesday, August 11. Arrived in town at 4.45 A.M. One and one-half mile haul to lot. Bert Antes, an American soldier, fell back during parade, and while trying to catch up ran over a little boy and cut his right leg badly, and left several other bad bruises on his body. At 6.50 a wind-storm struck us and the canvas on the east side went down, and at 7.05 the west side came over into the arena, carrying electric light poles and lamps with it; both horse tents and dressing-room were let down, and in fifteen minutes the place looked like a wreck. Things were in a bad condition, and orders were given to pack as no show would be attempted to-night. It was a hard pack up, and everything went backwards, and we did not get through much before our regular time. From this time on we will keep our weather-eye open for the little white clouds. / Business big in the afternoon. / Lot, Terrace and Pine streets. / Arena, 186 x 338.
