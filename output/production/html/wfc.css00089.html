   <div class="note">Note 1: In this context, the term "segregation" refers to the legal process of reserving a tract of undeveloped public land for a specific use. In this case, William F. Cody and his partners in the Shoshone Irrigation Company applied for a segregation under the Carey Act of 1894.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: Hudson W. Darrah (1864-1929), a sawmill owner with other business interests in and around the town of Cody, had a history of legal disputes with the Shoshone Irrigation Company. In 1899, Darrah filed a protest against the issuance of land patents for portions of the company's Carey Act segregation including the Cody townsite, claiming that the company had not yet adequately irrigated the area in question. While Darrah's protest was not upheld when adjudicated by government authorities in July 1900, it did delay the acquisition of clear title to these lands by settlers and investors who had filed claims for them. Since the company's profitability depended on selling water rights to settlers who expected to gain clear title to the irrigated lands under the Carey Act, protests such as Darrah's were a threat to the business interests of William F. Cody and his partners.</div>
