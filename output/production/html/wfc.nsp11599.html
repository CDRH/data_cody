      <p class="tei_p">BUFFALO BILL and his braves have brought the Wild West to the comparitively tame East, and classic Bellgrove in a week or two will echo to the tympanum terrifying whoop of the red skins. I have seen them—<a href="../item/wfc.person#kicking.bear">Kicking Bear</a>, <a href="../item/wfc.person#short.bull">Short Bull</a>, <a href="../item/wfc.person#lonebull">Lone Bull</a>, <a href="../item/wfc.person#noneck">No Neck</a>, Coming Grant,<a name="n01.ref"/>
         <a href="#n01.note" class="ref"> [1] </a> White Cloud,<a name="n02.ref"/>
         <a href="#n02.note" class="ref"> [2] </a> High Bear,<a name="n03.ref"/>
         <a href="#n03.note" class="ref"> [3] </a>
         <a href="../item/wfc.person#noneck.j">Johnny Burke</a>, and all the rest of them. They greeted me with a melancholy "How," and together we smoked the calumet of peace. Short Bull is, in my opinion, the noblest Indian of 'em all. He is a diplomatist, and was leader of the "Ghost Dancers," and High Priest during the Messiah craze. Comparatively few months ago he and the other reds were boring large irregular apertures in the pale faces with the coy, sweet-tongued Winchester repeater.</p>
