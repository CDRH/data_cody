      <h3>THE REFEREE.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">The Wild West Show went a great deal better on Wednesday, and was enthusiastically received by a tremendous audience of half-crowners. The world of rank and fashion and beauty had flocked to the Exhibition. I noted a host of improvements both in the arena and in the auditorium. The "stage management" I spoke about last week has been brought to bear on the performance. Later in the day the courteous general manager, Major <a href="../item/wfc.person#burke.j">Burke</a>, discovered me in some extraordinary way, for I always wear my hat well down over my nose and preserve a strict incognito, and personally conducted me over the encampment, introducing me to <a href="../item/wfc.person#red.shirt">Red Shirt</a> and <a href="../item/wfc.person#taylor.w">Buck Taylor</a>, Miss <a href="../item/wfc.person#oakley.a">Annie Oakley</a>
