      <h3>THE HORTICULTURAL EXHIBITION AND THE WILD WEST SHOW.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">The last days of the International Horticultural Exhibition and Buffalo Bill's Wild West are announced, though the attendance continues to be as great as ever, over 20,000 persons having assembled in the gardens on Saturday to hear "The British Army Quadrilles," with its stirring incidents, marches past, and firework accompaniments. The total number of visitors since the opening day have, up to date, reached close upon 2,000,000. Colonel Cody gives his last performance to-morrow; but the gardens, side-shows, and many other attractions of the exhibition will remain open till the end of the week.</p>
