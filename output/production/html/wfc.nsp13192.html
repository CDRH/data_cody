      <h3>Pigeon Shooting.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">The return pigeon shooting match between Miss <a href="../item/wfc.person#oakley.a">Annie Oakley</a> and John Brewer took place at Point Breeze Park yesterday afternoon. The former made a much better score than in the Pastime Park match, killing twenty-four straight, beginnning with the twenty-fourth bird. She was then one bird ahead of Brewer, with two to shoot at. Brewer brought down both of his, while the lady let hers escape and thus lost the match by one bird. Score:</p>
