         <a name="n01.note"> </a>Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, September 4, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "Stevens' Point, Wis. / Friday, September 4. Arrived in town at 6.30 A. M. One and one quarter mile haul to lot. This is a typical one-horse town, with no street cars, and the worst kind of sandy streets. We had a great hustle to night in order to get the second section out first, as it had to be all loaded and ready to leave town at 10.45, and considering the long haul it was quick work. / Business, big in the afternoon, fair at night. / Lot, Fay street and Wisconsin avenue. / Arena, 189 x 363."   <a href="#n01.ref"> [back] </a>
