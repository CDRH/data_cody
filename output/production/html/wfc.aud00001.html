      <p class="tei_p">The opponents of intervention have no substitute proposition. They have no plans
save those that have already failed. If the government were guided by their
advice, butchery, devastation, and barbarity would become permanent social
conditions in Cuba, and the unrest, the tumult, and the passion of the last
sixty days would take their places as established features of our national
life.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">No man who is not willing to hear about the hideous crimes in Cuba, to read the
war speeches of jingo Senators, and look upon the war headlines of the yellow
journals every day in the year for the remainder of their natural life has any
right to oppose intervention in Cuba unless he submits an effective plan for the
permanent abatement of these nuisances, which, in the language of the President,
have become intolerable.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">There is one more consideration. Any American who finds himself unable now to
support the president in his proposed policy towards Spain shows himself to be
perfectly content that this country should exhibit itself with an attitude of a
nation that will not fight for its peace and safety, for its honor and
self-respect, or in the performance of its duty imposed by humanity and
civilization.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Ladies and gentlemen, permit me to introduce to you, a Congress of the Rough
Riders of the World.</p>
