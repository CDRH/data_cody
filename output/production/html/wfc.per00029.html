         <span class="tei_l">July 10, 1912. </span>
         <span class="tei_l">Buffalo Bill &amp; Pawnee Bill Film Co.,</span>
         <span class="tei_l">145 West 45th Street,</span>
         <span class="tei_l">New York City, N. Y.</span>
      </span>
      <p class="tei_p">Gentlemen:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In reply to your inquiry concerning the letter purported to be signed by Major Gordon W. Lillie, as manager for Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Pawnee Bill's Great Far East Company, published in the Moving Picture World, issued July 13th , 1912, I beg to advise you as follows:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">1. — It is true that Col. Cody and Major Lillie caused a notice to be served that they appealed from the order of Justice Gerard, denying their motion for an injunction, but the time to prosecute the appeal has expired by lapse of time.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">2. — The attorney for Col. Cody and Major Lillie has written us to the effect that they wish to serve an amended complaint. This is practically an admission by their attorney that their action now pending would fail. </p>
      <p class="tei_p">3. — From an examination of the contracts and the facts in the case, I advise you that you have the sole and exclusive right to produce, manufacture, sell, license and exhibit the picture, "Life of Buffalo Bill," and you may make contracts with your customers accordingly.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">4. — I consider that the statements contained in the published letter of Major Lillie are libellous as against your company, and pursuant to your instructions will proceed to prepare the necessary papers for the purpose of instituting suit on your behalf by reason thereof.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Very truly yours, WALDO G. MORSE.</p>
