      <p class="tei_p">Buffalo Bill has been telling an interviewer that he intends to give up showmanship shortly, and no wonder. Colonel Cody has had a hard time of it, for two such shows as he has gone through each day for twenty years ought to be good enough for most men. The gentle Bill states that he will cease to be a showman after the Chicago Exhibition, but that he will visit England again as an ordinary mortal later on. Colonel Cody does not approve of "Bible-back thumpers," who, he says, attempted to prevent him bringing his Indians over by telling lies and things about his management of the Wild West. However, it is gratifying to learn that the influence of American "Bible-back thumpers" in America is on a par with that which the strange breed of wildfowl possess in this country, "not worth a bean."</p>
