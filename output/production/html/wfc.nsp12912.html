      <p class="tei_p">The <a href="../item/wfc.person#victoria.q">Queen</a> has this week honoured Buffalo Bill by witnessing the performance of his troop in the Home Park, and was much interested in the feats of the wild riders. The Gauchos of the South American Pampas has recently been added to the already various group. They are the descendants of the early Spanish colonisers of the south American wilds, and are half-Spanish, half-Indian. The Gaucho is not unjustly described as the mythical Centaur. He spends the greater part of his life on horseback, and is associated with the wild horses of the southern wastes from his earliest days. At an age when the English or American child is learning to stand alone, the infant Gaucho is taught by his mother to balance himself on the backs of the colts of the herd, and at four or five has learned to ride the wildest of them.</p>
