      <p class="tei_p">Bison William—he of the Wild West Show—will go on a big hunting expedition to the Grand Canon of Colorado as soon as his season in London has terminated. Col. Cody does everything on a vast scale, and this tour of pleasure will be quite as elaborate an affair as if it were one of business. He has invited ten friends to be his companions in the hunt. A special train will take the party from New York to a place called Flagstaff, in Arizona, and from that point the ten Nimrods will go by saddle and buckboard waggon to the lair of the bear and the home of the buffalo. Already the horses and waggons have been sent on. Col. Cody had long been the most industrious part of his own show, and sadly wants a change. Before going to the Canon he may arrange for a long-distance ride from New York to Chicago between a Mexican, an Indian, and a cowboy.</p>
