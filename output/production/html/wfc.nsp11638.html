      <p class="tei_p">BUFFALO BILL.—It has been arranged that the Cowboy Band in connection with the now famous Wild West Show, assisted by the troupe of tyrolean vocalists and the Sioux Indians, who for the last few months have been entertaining the large audiences in Glasgow, will give an exhibition in the Victoria Hall on Thursday evening. The entertainment will consist mainly of a musical festival, including selections of the best American music, but the audience will also have the unique pleasure of witnessing the Indians in their native war and other dances. The prices of admission have been fixed at very moderate sums, and it is expected that large numbers in Hamilton will avail themselves of witnessing this novel exhibition of life in the Wild West before the performers leave for their own country.</p>
