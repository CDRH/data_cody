      <h3>THE CEMETERY TRAGEDY.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">Mr. <a href="../item/wfc.person#burke.j">John Burke</a>, of Buffalo Bill's Wild West, writes from Earl's-court contradicting Howard's statement that he was connected with Col. Cody's troupe. "Howard," he says, "has had no connection whatever with the Wild West, with the exception of having been given (as a matter of charity) a position in the stables. He never came here with the gauchos or with the South American wild horses."</p>
