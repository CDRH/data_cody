      <p class="tei_p">As a good deal of scepticism appears to exist about the farewell performances of "Buffalo Bill's" unique company of equestrians now at West Brompton, I am authoritatively assured that the last show will take place on Oct. 12, and that the company will sail on the 15th inst. in the s. s. Mohawk. All those of my readers, therefore, who have not witnessed the "Wild West" should lose no time, as in all probability they will never have another opportunity of seeing such a wonderful collection of horsemen gathered together again. </p>
