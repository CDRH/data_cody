      <p class="tei_p">Colonel Cody, otherwise Buffalo Bill, is European in celebrity. He has visited London, he has conquered Paris, and now he comes to subjugate Scotland at the buildings of the East-end Exhibition in Duke Street. On Monday, the 9th, which happens to be the fiftieth—or rather the fifty-first—birthday of the <a href="../item/wfc.person#albert.edward">Prince of Wales</a>, Colonel Cody will bring to Scotland the biggest show of its kind in creation.</p>
