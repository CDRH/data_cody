         </span> I do hope you will push the work and get the water down. You should have commenced sooner. I told you I would send the 1000- did I ever fail yet. When we get a rail road which will be in side of three years— and our town numbers thousands and land worth $100 an acre— then I wont have such hard work getting my colleagues to put up— The B.M.<a name="n02.ref"/>
         <a href="#n02.note" class="ref"> [2] </a> will build to us sure—</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Our settlers should plant every acre possible. They will get their own prices next winter. Now is the time to farm before the rail road gets there—</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Write me fully. When will you have water in Cody?</p>
