But as their contract was up or made out this way before  they wished their money as soon as the show closed.  but this will be much better for them each and all will have a little money when they arrive at the Agency. <a name="n02.ref"/>

         <a name="n01.note"> </a>Note 1: The Wild West's employment contracts with Indian performers had to be approved by the agent in charge of the reservation where the Indians resided.  In this case, it appears that Agent Penney took an active role in drafting the contracts himself. <a href="#n01.ref"> [back] </a>

This was a common element in Wild West Indian contracts for the remainder of Cody's show career. <a href="#n02.ref"> [back] </a>
