      <p class="tei_p">In reply to your favor of Jan 14th 1916 — Will say The reason  <span class="tei_del">the</span>  of the long delay for the delivery of the Indian War Pictures was that I was in the west. But in December last I took the Reels my self to Washington. I called at Secretary Lanes<a name="n02.ref"/>
         <a href="#n02.note" class="ref"> [2] </a> office. But failing to find him I called on Secretary Garrison<a name="n03.ref"/>
         <a href="#n03.note" class="ref"> [3] </a>. And left the Reels or Films with his Secretary who promised to notify Secretary Lane that he had a set of the Reels or films for his department. If you will kindly communicate  <span class="tei_del">with</span>  with the Secretary to Secretary Garrison, I think you will find everything allright.</p>
