      <h3>HORSE SENSE.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">One of, if not <em class="hi">the</em> most generally admired items in the varied programme of the "Wild West" at Earl's Court is the cross-country ride. "Mr. Jersey," who is a constant patron of the arena, has several times given valuable prizes to be run for. Last week a purse of £10 was gained by a neck by an Indian rider. The competitors generally are an Englishman in hunting costume, an American in frock coat and top hat, a cowboy, and a Mexican Vacquero. Yesterday the red-coated Englishman, mounted on a chestnut mare, was thrown over her head as she was clearing the first hurdle. The mare continued her course riderless taking hurdle after hurdle. Finally she passed the leading horse with a rush, and won the race by a length amid the cheers of the spectators. Then the evidently elated animal made a circuit of the arena. On reaching Buffalo Bill, who sits on horseback out in the arena holding a blue flag marked "winner" to be handed to the winning horseman, she stopped and looked wistfully at the flag. Colonel Cody, whose smile of wonderment ripened into a hearty laugh, then extended the flag. The mare took the stick between her teeth, and trotted out of the arena.</p>
