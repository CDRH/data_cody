      <p class="tei_p">Tremendous jubilation agitated the Wild West camp at Salford, on Ash Wednesday. There was no performance, owing to a wise and beneficent law passed by the illustrious senators of Salford. So they had "a day off." This day they devoted to the christening of the Indian baby.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The ceremony took place at St. Clement's Church, and a crowd of spectators assembled, all the notabilities of the Show being well to the fore.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">It would have brought tears of joy to a Wild Western editor's eyes to have heard <a href="../item/wfc.person#irving.w">Broncho Bill</a>—of the Smith and Western persuasion—making the responses for <a href="../item/wfc.person#little.chief">Little Chief</a>. But the nicest thing of all was to see <a href="../item/wfc.person#burke.j">Major Burke</a> assisting to take the collection. There are few things the genial Major has not taken in his career, from scalps downwards, but this is the first occasion, I should imagine, on which he has ever assisted in a "show" of this kind.</p>
