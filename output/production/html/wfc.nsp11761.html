      <span class="tei_byline">[FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.]</span>

      <span class="tei_dateline">ROME, March 2.</span>

      <p>The Vatican authorizes me to say that there is no truth in the report of Dr. McGlynn's case being re-opened.</p>

      <p>No communication, direct or indirect, has been received about this case since it was closed. The only way it can be re-opened is through Archbishop Corrigan or Dr. McGlynn's personal recantation.</p>

      <p>The first observation in the Vatican meteorological observatory, opened to-day, was a snowstorm, the first one in two years. Bulletins are to be published every day.</p>

      <p>The Vatican's official organ claims that the German Emperor was inspired to issue the labor rescripts by a former speech of Pope Leo XIII. to the French workingmen. It commends the Emperor's attitude.</p>

      <p>His Holiness yesterday received the Cardinals and the Prelates of his household on the occasion of his birthday. In the course of a speech he spoke of his intention to publish a new encyclical on the social question.</p>

      <p>There is a tremendous rush for tickets to the Vatican to-morrow, when the Pope celebrates the anniversary of his coronation and receives Buffalo Bill with his Indians and cowboys.</p>

      <p>Special permission has been granted, allowing Indians and cowboys to appear without swallow tail coats.</p>
