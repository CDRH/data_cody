      <p class="tei_p">Oh, perfidious Albion! It is really terrible to think of the wicked wiles of Englishmen. Many people are doubtless aware that at the revived "Buffalo Billeries" at Earls Court a Cossack band is amongst the attractions. But have they thought of what this means? They may say they have not, but the shrewd people of Paris know better. It is all a vile British plot to weaken the friendship between France and Russia, and is a proof of jealousy and spite. What awful people we are, if we only knew it.</p>
