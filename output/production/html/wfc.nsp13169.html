      <h3>PRESENTATION TO BUFFALO BILL.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">LAST week a conference of delegates from the various branches of the London Working Men's Association was held at the Wild West Show, when an illuminated address was presented to Colonel W. F. Cody. The chair was occupied by Mr. George Potter, president of the association, who was supported by Mr. F. Whetstone (vice-president). Mr. F. Wigington (treasurer), and Mr. Robert Wilson (secretary), and there was a large attendance. In presenting the address, which congratulated Buffalo Bill on the splendour of his show, its value from an education standpoint, and the success which had attended his visit, now fast drawing to a close, Mr. George Potter said that those whom he represented admired the colonel's pluck and appreciated his indomitable courage. The delegates were afterwards entertained at a substantial tea, and after each member had been presented with a portrait of Buffalo Bill, bearing his autograph, they witnessed a performance of the Wild West Show.</p>
