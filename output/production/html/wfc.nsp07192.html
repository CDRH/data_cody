      <h3>Buffalo Bill in England.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">Buffalo Bill, in going to England, deviated from the usual custom of less illustrious travelers. Instead of putting himself at once into the hands of London's tailor, Poole,<a name="n01.ref"/>
         <a href="#n01.note" class="ref"> [1] </a> as soon as he arrived, he chose to supply himself with a liberal outfit in America, and he landed on the other side with any amount of "store clothes." One suit, in which he intends to pay his respects to the <a href="../item/wfc.person#victoria.q">queen</a>, is of dark gray; another, in which he will appear at the queen's jubilee as Nebraska's representative, is two shades of blue, while a gorgeous hunting costume, which, perhaps, will be seen in Windsor forest, consists of blue corduroy jacket, gray corduroy trousers and scarlet and brown waistcoat.—<em class="hi">New York Sun.</em>
