Court, to-morrow (Saturday), when he will repeat the performances given in the "Jubilee" year. The Hon. W. F. Cody's biography is well known, thanks to the widespread circulation of the various pamphlets and leaflets descriptive of his life. Originally he was a Government scout in the service of the United States, and saw much service in Indian warfare. Later he became a Senator, and formed a company of ex-scouts and cowboys to give an exhibition of their prowess. This is known all over the world, and no doubt Buffalo Bill has made a fortune out of it. His show remains at West Brompton until October, after which the company return to America for the purpose of appearing at the Chicago Exhibition.</div>
