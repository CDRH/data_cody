      <h3>THE INDIAN RISING.</h3>
      <span class="tei_milestone"/>
      <p class="tei_p">The American soldiers and the Indians have commenced hostile operations. The latter, however, have received a blow through the death of their well-known leader "<a href="../item/wfc.person#sitting.bull">Sitting Bull</a>." He was being arrested by the police, when an attempt at rescue was made, in the midst of which he was shot.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">
         <a href="../item/wfc.person#oakley.a">Miss Annie Oakley</a>, "Little Surefoot" of Colonel Cody's Wild West Exhibition, who is now on a visit in Ashford, speaks kindly of poor old Sitting Bull, the famous Siöux Chief, who has recently been killed by the United States Indian police. She knew him well during her career in the Wild West, and she says that he had far too good cause too often given him to take up arms in his own defence and that of his people. His disposition was neither aggressive nor cruel, nor would he have molested any one if he had not been first molested. But the lands of his tribes were invaded, their means of subsistence impaired, and faith was not kept with them. She says he was a man for whose fate anyone acquainted with him would feel pity.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Another tribute to the memory of the old man was paid on Wednesday evening at Kennington by the late Rev. Canon Cooper, late missionary in Columbia. This gentleman stated that Sitting Bull, even when on the war path, was by no means savage or aggressive to unarmed Europeans; on the contrary, he was friendly and generous to missionaries and others who desired to live at peace with him and treated him fairly.</p>
