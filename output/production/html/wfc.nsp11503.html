         <a href="../item/wfc.person#otakte">Kills-Many</a> or Killed-His-Pony, the young Indian who died of consumption at Bellevue Hospital yesterday, will sleep his last sleep in the land of the Red Men. He was a Sioux of the Lacotah tribe, and thanks to the kind interest of the Hon. W. F. Cody, <a href="../item/wfc.person#obeirne.j">Gen. J. R. O'Beirne</a> and <a href="../item/wfc.person#crager.g">George C. Crager</a>, a Sioux interpreter, engaged Undertaker Michael P. Daly, who took the remains from the Morgue to-day. To-night they will be sent by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad to Pine Ridge, Dakota, when they will be taken to the primeval wilderness and interred with Sioux rites.</p>
