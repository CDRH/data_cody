      <p class="tei_p">An Omaha dispatch says: The Indians displaced a rail of the Union Pacific Railroad near Sidney on Saturday, by which a freight train was thrown from the track and the fireman killed. The wrecking train going west was obliged to return in consequence of the appearance of a large body of Indians. The troops from Forts McPherson and Russell have been sent to protect the railroad men. All was quiet at the last accounts.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Five desperados were hung near Gilmer on Friday by a Vigilance Committee.</p>
