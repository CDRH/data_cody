      <p class="tei_p">MARRIAGE OF BUFFALO BILL'S INTERPRETER.—Considerable interest was aroused on Monday at the County Buildings by the arrival of a marriage company from the Wild West Exhibition. The contracting parties were Mr <a href="../item/wfc.person#shangreaux.j">John Shangraun</a>, Buffalo Bill's interpreter, and Miss Lillie Orr, said to be the daughter of a Liverpool ship captain. The marriage took place before Sheriff Spens, the "best maid" being one of the Indian women, who appeared in her picturesque native costume with all her ornaments.</p>
