      <p class="tei_p">Ten Cossacks, under the leadership of Prince Ivan Makharadze, intended for Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show at Earls Court, arrived in Paris the other day. They are the first Cossacks that have been brought out of Russia for any except warlike purposes. This is a portion of Buffalo Bill's project of exhibiting at the "Wild West" representative riders from all parts of the world.</p>
