   <div class="note">Note 1: BBWW performed in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on September 3, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "Green Bay, Wis. / Thursday, September 3. Arrived in town at 3.30 A. M. One and one-half mile haul to lot. The weather turned very cold to-night—the coldest day of the season. There was the largest concert house this afternoon that we ever had—every reserve seat was taken, and George Fursman smiled as we have never seen him smile before, and even "Pop" Rasey was pleased. / Business, big in the afternoon, fair at night. / Lot, Webster avenue and Polier street. / Arena, 190 x 408."</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: "People at Irma" are those who were to settle in the Irma Flats area, named after Cody's daughter and located in the upper South Fork Valley.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 3: The "Town" officially became Cody, Wyoming, in August 1896.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 4: Red Bluffs, a hill formation to the south and west of Cody, Wyoming, that stands out among the mountainous formations due to its red color.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 5: Charles Trego (1856-1925), a personal friend of Cody's and foreman for both Scout's Rest Ranch in North Platte, Nebraska, and the TE Ranch in Cody, Wyoming.</div>
