      <p>BUFFALO BILL is a much more picturesque figure on the Glasgow landscape than the First Lord. I spent several hours in his company this week, and found him in conversation as unconventional and as interesting as he is in appearance and pursuits. At Bellgrove he is scooping in the dollars in a way which the public will hardly credit. The huge show is crammed every night, and <span class="italic">matinees</span> are equally well attended. I have every reason to believe that on Wednesdays and Saturdays the Colonel nets about a thousand pounds per day, almost enough to pay the whole week's expenses connected with the entertainment.</p>
