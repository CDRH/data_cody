      <h3>Amusements in London.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">The popularity of the Horticultural Exhibition and the Wild West was more than ever evidenced on Monday. From 11 o'clock in the forenoon until 11 at night the grounds were thronged with visitors. The chief charm of the exhibition lay in the two gardens, where the bands of the Grenadier Guards, under Lieut. Dan Godfrey, and the 2nd Life Guards, under Mr. Leonard Barker, occupied in turns the two stands. The "Wild West Show" of Buffalo Bill, enlarged and improved, commands a large share of popular favour. On Monday there were as usual two performances, and on each occasion the place was crowded, over 26,000 persons attending. At the Horticultural Show the attendance was 29,258.</p>
