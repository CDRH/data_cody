      <p class="tei_p">At the two hundredth performance of Buffalo Bill's "Wild West," which took place on Thursday, Colonel Cody commemorated the occasion by presenting his visitors with a well-executed photograph of himself. The attendance has lately considerably increased, owing partly to the near approach of the farewell performance in England, and for the 100 days that the International Horticultural Exhibition has been open the number of people who have passed the turnstiles has exceeded 1,400,000.</p>
