      <div class="note">Samuel Stone Hall (1838-1886), known as "Buckskin Sam."  Born in Massachusetts, Hall joined the Texas Rangers before the Civil War.  Deserting the Rangers in 1864, he served briefly in the Union army as a member of a Massachusetts militia regiment. Drawing on his western experiences, Hall wrote over fifty dime novels for the firm of Beadle and Adams between 1877 and 1886, at least one of which featured Buffalo Bill as the title character.  Hall lived the last years of his life in Wilmington, Delaware.</div>
