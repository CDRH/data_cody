      <p class="tei_p">There is no room for a frenzied suggestion that has been made to the effect that the realistic scenes of torture and lynching added to the Wild West Show at Earl's Court this week should be prohibited on the score of impropriety. So far from the hanging of the horse thief (which is the item objected to) being a gruesome horror it is received with roars of laughter. The spectators see that the culprit is well protected by a leather apron and leather collar. They laugh when the culprit is hung up, and they laugh when the cowboys circle round and fire round after round of blank cartridge into his quivering body. But an Earl's Court audience is prone to merriment, and would laugh at some things that the Country Council might weep over. </p>
