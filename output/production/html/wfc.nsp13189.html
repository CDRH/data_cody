      <p class="tei_p">JUST before closing her engagement with the Wild West Show in this city, <a href="../item/wfc.person#oakley.a">Annie Oakley</a> accomplished the notable feat of picking her hat from the ground while she was riding at full speed. She and many others believe that this was never before done from a side-saddle by anything in the semblance of woman.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">AT the matinee at Madison-square Garden on Washington's Birthday Miss Annie Oakley was presented with a gold medal from the Ladies' Riding Club, making the fourth medal that has come her way since she opened in New York. She left for her home in Ohio 24.</p>
