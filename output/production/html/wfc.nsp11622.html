      <p class="tei_p">THE principal place of resort, par excellence, during the holidays is sure to be Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. The different tableaux are received nightly by crowded audiences with every evidence of appreciation, and as an insight into frontier life in America it would be impossible to approach nearer to reality.
