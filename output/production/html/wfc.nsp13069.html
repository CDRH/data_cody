      <p class="tei_p">At the Wild West Show spectators are supposed to see the power of man to tame the wild buck-jumper, but are we to believe all we see? What we should like to known is whether the "genuine article" is being shown us or a faked-up representation, with trained horses, of what buck-jumping is not. Wild the horses may be to start with, but they can scarcely remain so after being forced so often to acknowledge man as their master. Colonel Cody undoubtedly gave us to understand that his steeds were by no means cab horses in their temperament; yet he has now put up huge posters in the streets announcing the sale of his spirited family, who, he declares, are "warranted free from vice." Truly we live and learn. </p>
