      <p class="tei_p">On Thursday last, the successful Yankee who is now running "Venice," at Olympia, gave a pleasant dinner party to about 200 friends—most of the guests being Italian, and the rest "gentlemen of the Press." It was a good feed, and greatly enjoyed, but much better were the cozy banquets given at Buffalo Bill's adjoining show. The Red Indians took all the shine out of Venice, and people would certainly prefer seeing them. Buffalo Bill related some of his "experiences" at the Lyric Club two or three nights ago, and was the star of the evening.</p>
