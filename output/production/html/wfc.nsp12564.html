      <p class="tei_p">There was quite an unrehearsed reproduction of Buffalo Bill's Wild West buck-jumping exhibition in a field in close proximity to the Alexandra Park last night. The cowboys were represented by seven or eight young urchins, and the wild, unbroken steeds were seven or eight "cuddies," belonging to some local coal-dealer. The show went on uninterruptedly for over an hour, and seemed to be greatly relished by quite a crowd of people who lined the railings of the field. The heroic efforts and 'cuteness of the youngsters in mounting "Neddy," and the catapultic fashion in which the mokes discharged their riders, was laughable in the extreme. However, the fun was too good to last, as a "birl" from a policeman who eventually appeared on the scene put the "cowboys" to hasty flight.</p>
