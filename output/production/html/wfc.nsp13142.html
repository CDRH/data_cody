      <p class="tei_p">Major <a href="../item/wfc.person#burke.j">Burke</a>, of Buffalo Bill's Wild West, writes to say that he is being "scrawled to death by bilious scribes." Some of the London newspaper men, it seems, have taken objection to the terms of an advertisement, which says that the big show is leaving England on the 15th inst., "never to return." The Major says that <em class="hi">he</em> is responsible for the announcement, and in making it he endeavoured to tell the truth. It was painful, but he tried to do it. Before the great sail takes place there will be a great sale—of horses, polo ponies, Russian cobs, and the four-in-hand Kentucky mule team that has so long drawn the Deadwood coach through fiery whirl-blasts of the deadly blank cartridge. In grateful memory of the help afforded us by Buffalo Bill in raising our Balaclava Relief Fund, I am happy to give the show this modicum of puff valedictory, and to urge those of my readers who mean to pay the Wild West a visit before it leaves London to "Be in time, be in time."</p>
