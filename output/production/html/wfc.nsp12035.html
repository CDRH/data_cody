      <h3>THE "WILD WEST AT EARL'S COURT</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">Buffalo Bill and his troupe of cowboys and Indians have returned to the scene of their triumphs in the Jubilee year. Buffalo Bill, Miss <a href="../item/wfc.person#oakley.a">Annie Oakley</a> and the Deadwood coach are some of the best-known of the old friends, and, among the Indians, there are many, it is said, who were engaged in the most recent skirmishes with the U.S. troopers. The show seems not to have lost any of its power of attracting, and the bucking horses, the races, and the Indian warfare are as welcome and amusing as they were five years ago.</p>
