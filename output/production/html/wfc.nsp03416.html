      <h3>DISSATISFIED INDIANS.</h3>
      <h3>Prospect of Another Outbreak Among the Braves at Pine Ridge.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">
         <span class="bold">CHICAGO, March 14.</span>—Dr. O. A. Eastman, an educated Ogallalla Sioux, arrived here to-day from Pine Ridge. In an interview in a local paper he says he has been in the camps of the Indians at Pine Ridge, and from present indications the probability of another Indian war is promising. There is great discontent among the Indians. Personally he does not think they will do anything desperate but the young braves are holding secret conferences, and even the conservative men are talking of war. The people out there are dissatisfied at not having received information as to how the hostiles at Fort Sheridan are being treated, and fear treachery.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Buffalo Bill has secured the consent of the Government, and will in a few days start for Europe with the hostile Sioux now held at Fort Sheridan. They are to make a part of his Wild West Show. He will make up a party of 100 Indians from those on the reservation.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">
         <span class="bold">CHEYENNE, March 14.</span>—Acting Governor Barber has issued a proclamation enjoining the citizens to refrain from selling arms to the Indians. This was done on the request of <a href="../item/wfc.person#miles.n">Gen. Miles</a>, who says the Indians can be handled easily if not supplied with rifles.</p>
