      <p class="tei_p">Under Frankey's guidance, I made my way through further rows of neat tents, until we arrived at that inhabited by Miss<a href="../item/wfc.person#"> Annie Oakley</a>, the champion lady shot of America. This young lady is possessed of a decidedly pretty and winsome face, of sweet and gentle manners, and a soft, girlish voice. Having been formerly introduced, Miss Oakley proceeded to give me a few particulars of her life and adventures.</p>
      <p class="tei_ab">AN AMAZONIAN RIFLE SHOOTER.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">"I am about twenty years of age," said this young Amazon, "and have been fond of shooting from the time I was a toddling mite. At the age of twelve I was presented with a fourteen-guage muzzle-loading shot-gun. With this I practised all day long, and became so good a shot that by the time I had reached the age of fourteen I had paid off a mortgage on my father's homestead with money earned from the sale of game and skins, shot and trapped entirely by myself. Once at a place called Tiffin, in Ohio, I shot a ten-cent. piece, held between the thumb and forefinger of an attendant, at a distance of 30 feet. In 1884 I attempted to beat the best record made at balls thrown in the air, using a 22-cal. rifle. The best record was 979, made by Dr. Ruth. I used a Stevens 22-cal. rifle, and broke 944. A few months after this I attempted the feat of shooting at 5,000 balls in one day, loading the guns myself. I used three 16-guage hammer guns. The balls were thrown straight away from the three traps, fifteen yards rise. Out of the 5,000 shot at I broke 4,772. On the second thousand I only missed 16, making the best 1,000 ball record—984. I took nine hours to do the whole thing. I have shot in many thousands of exhibitions, in thirty-one matches and tournaments, and have won twenty-five prizes. In shooting clay pigeons I have recorded ninety-six out of one hundred, in live pigeons twenty-three out of twenty-five, and I have received congratulations from Budd, Stice, Erb, <a href="../item/wfc.person#bogardus.a">Bogardus</a>, Cody, <a href="../item/wfc.person#carver.w">Carver</a>, and the English champions, Graham and Price."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Miss Oakley having kindly showed me her numerous costly medals, of which she possesses quite a magnificent collection, and having assured me that she does not claim any championship, but looks upon her skill merely as a matter of dollars and cents, Frankey White bore me off to other <span class="tei_gap_reason_missing tei_gap">[missing]</span> camp. <em class="hi">En route</em> for the stables <span class="tei_gap_reason_truncated tei_gap">[truncated]</span>
