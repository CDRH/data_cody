      <p class="tei_p">Buffalo Bill has been been communicating to an interviewer attached to the <em class="hi">Players</em> that he is going out of the "show business." The Chicago Exhibition, he explains, "will wind him up as a showman." Then he will return to that idyllic life for which he yearns. Said the gallant Colonel:—</p>
      <span class="tei_quote">I was born on the frontier, and all my early life I lived on lit. When the towns followed us we moved further on, and so kept clear of them. That's what I want to go back to. I want to ride my horse on the plains, not in the arena. I want to look my mother Nature in the face again, and shake hands with her in her home.</span>
      <p class="tei_p">When he leaves the show business the Colonel will retire to his little place out West—or one of them, for he has two. "I've a little place," he said, "with 95,000 acres at the foot of the Rocky Mountains that is good enough for me when the other place gets too hot. On that I can shoot mountains lions and bears from morning till night, and game of all kinds; and, if I want to fish, there's trout enough in the streams to satisfy any fisherman." Also, he has a ranch in Nebraska containing 10,000 acres and hundreds of horses and cattle.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Colonel Cody intends to have his Wild West, with the Indians and the untamed buck-jumpers and the other accessories, at Chicago next year; but there will be some additional features, including a genuine cyclone and a prairie-fire. It is to be hoped these "turns" will not be made too realistic. People who want to see Buffalo Bill again must be quick about it. The show will only be open for another fortnight. </p>
