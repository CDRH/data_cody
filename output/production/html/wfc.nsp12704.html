      <h3>OLD FRIENDS.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">Mrs Ricks, the old black lady from West Africa who has come to London to see the Queen, discovered the other day an old neighbour in Colonel Cody, writes the London correspondent of the <em class="hi">Nottingham Guardian</em>. She was taken, with a considerable retinue, to see the glories of the Wild West, and was introduced by the Liberian Minister to Buffalo Bill. In the course of the conversation it transpired that she was a native of Tennessee, having gone back to Africa after the war. It was in Tennessee that Colonel Cody resided up to the time of the war, and it was in that State that he achieved military distinction in the campaign. Mrs Ricks became very animated in her conversation when this was known, and was very full of her enthusiasm over the reception which the "great white Queen" had so graciously accorded to her.</p>
