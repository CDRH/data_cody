      <p class="tei_p">George— I am speaking plain. I am getting the blame for this kind of management and I propose to land the blame where it belongs I am sick and tired of nonsense— and will stand it no longer— Business has got to be done on business principles or as the others say. I will say my self I will not put up another dollar and give my reasons for so doing. I was in hopes you would quit nonsense and get down to business—</p>
