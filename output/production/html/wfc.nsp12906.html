      <h3>THE VERY WILD WEST.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">With real buffaloes, real Indians, real cowboys, real Cossacks, and real Gauchos at Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show at Olympia it might reasonably have been thought that the apotheosis of realism had been reached. It appears, however, that the attractions of the exhibition are to be further enhanced by even more startling scenes than have hitherto been enacted in the arena. Buffalo hunting as an episode in the real Wild West of America is no longer possible, because there are no more buffaloes to hunt. Judging by newspaper reports, however, lynching is still a popular pastime in this interesting country, and the audiences at Earl's Court are to be initiated into the way in which it is done. The career of a horse thief and his final capture, trial and fate could be and are to be displayed with effective fidelity by Buffalo Bill and his merry men. </p>
