O'Day's greatest achievement may have been engineering the transfer of the oil-carrying trade from the Empire Transportation Company to the Erie Railroad. O'Day was instrumental in laying the first oil pipeline in the state of New York in 1873, building the first pipelines from the oilfields to New York City. O'Day acted as president and/or director of many budding banks and oil-related companies. Mr. O'Day was a close personal friend of John D.

In a previous letter dated September 25, 1895, Cody also refers to naming streets in the first planned town site, and the initial plats of the town of Cody in that original location show the streets named for generals. In the town site's later and current location, the main street of Sheridan Avenue, named for General <a href="../item/wfc.person#sheridan.p">Philip Sheridan</a>, is the only street honoring a general; the principal east-west streets were and still are named for founders of the town. <a href="#.ref"> [back] </a>
