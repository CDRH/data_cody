      <p class="tei_p">Looking in at Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show the other day my attention was attracted by rows upon rows of smiling young faces. I learned that they were the children of the Licensed Vctuallers' Schools, some 250 in number, who had been favoured with an invitation from Buffalo Bill to witness his performance. The girls were prettily dressed in mauve, with hats trimmed with the same colour. The boys wore neat little costumes and dark brown kid gloves, of which they seemed very proud. No doubt the entertainment was a rare treat to them. The children certainly did the institution credit.</p>
