Clifford (1859-1915), an experienced mining executive whose company had numerous mining claims in Colorado and other western states. Clifford is known to have corresponded with the inventor Thomas A.

In 1912, the partners realized that the earnings from their mines were unlikely to recoup their initial investments. Dyer died soon thereafter, and Cody tried without success to find a buyer for the mines. <a href="#n03.ref"> [back] </a>

As Cody indicates, Lillie went to his home in Pawnee, Oklahoma after the seizure. <a href="#n05.ref"> [back] </a>
