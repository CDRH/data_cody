      <p>I wrote you last night. Since then I have put in a bad night looking over your letter. You say 62 teams &amp; a 103 men will cost up to Dec. 1<span class="sup">st</span> from Oct 21 will cost 8.910. if it does they are <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="making​">makeing</a> big wages I tell you. I figure they work 30 days in that time. 62 teams and men at $3<span class="sup">00</span> a day for team &amp; man and 1.50 a day for 40 men extra is <del>7</del> $7,380. I have no idea what your flumes will cost.</p>
