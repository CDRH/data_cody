         <span class="tei_salute">Dear Tait:</span>
      </span>
      <p class="tei_p">Your kind letter received. We have opened and have a very good show, indeed.<a name="n01.ref"/>
         <a href="#n01.note" class="ref"> [1] </a> I think that business will be very good here, as the papers have given us splendid notices. Of course we miss Baker more than words can express.<a name="n02.ref"/>
         <a href="#n02.note" class="ref"> [2] </a> We also miss you and all the old guard.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am not appearing in the saddle this season, but drive in my carriage and I have sure got the prettiest pair of horses, and most sensible horses and the finest team I ever drove, and the people say that I look like "six bits" when I drive them into the arena and make my little talk and introduce <a href="../item/wfc.person#lillie.g">Major Lillie</a>.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Tait, I wish that you would write me your candid opinion regarding "Morning Star" and whether you think that it is going to be a big winner or not. Also where "Black Jack" is and what he is doing, and how everything is getting along at camp.<a name="n03.ref"/>
         <a href="#n03.note" class="ref"> [3] </a> Anything that your write me will be treated as strictly confidential.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Now, Tait, I am very busy and not very well. I often wish for you and, sooner or later, I would like to have you with me all the time, but first I have to see how the "cat is going to jump". I am very busy, and have so many letters to write, etc., and whether I write you or not, you keep on writing me. Good Luck.</p>
