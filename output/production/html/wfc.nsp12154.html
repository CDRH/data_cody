      <h3>COWBOYS AT ST. PAUL'S.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">There was a curious sight at St. Paul's Cathedral last Sunday morning, to which no attention has been called. All the Sioux Indians, Mexicans, cowboys, and the recently arrived Cossacks, who are part of Buffalo Bill's troupe, were at the morning service. The Indians were greatly impressed by the service, and particularly charmed by the music of the big organ. To this moment they cannot be made to understand where the sound came from and how it was produced.</p>
