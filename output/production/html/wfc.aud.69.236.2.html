      <p class="tei_p">There are four outdoor photographs that are part of the Gertrude Käsebier collection that are unlike all the rest, and those are the ones that show the plains of what we assume is South Dakota. Could this be photography done by Gertrude Käsebier? Possibly. Is there any documentation that indicates that? No, we haven't been able to find it anywhere. One image in particular shows two women with horses and children carrying their goods across the plains. It shows where the men and women were from that Käsebier was becoming friends with, knowing through the portrait sittings that she was doing, focused on the Indians and show performers of the Wild West, but also learning about who they were and where they were from.</p>
