   <div class="note">Note 1: This letter was probably written in 1916.  Other Cody letters dated 1916 mention "Mr. Haggard" (see note 3 below).</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: <span class="persName">
         <a href="/doc/elwell.r">Robert Farrington Elwell</a>
      </span> (1874-1962).</div>

   <div class="note">Note 3: "Mr. Haggard" is very likely Sewell Haggard (c. 1879-1928), an editor who then worked on magazines owned by William Randolph Hearst.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 4: In the last year of his life, William F. Cody worked on an autobiography to be published in installments by <span class="italic">Hearst's Magazine</span>.  Cody tried to persuade the magazine's editors to hire Elwell to illustrate the series, but the job went to N.C. Wyeth instead.</div>
