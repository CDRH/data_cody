      <p class="tei_p">BUFFALO WILLIAM as Artemus Ward quaintly calls our Wil[d] West hero is still attracting large crowds to the East-end, and no wonder, say some wise acres. See how they advertise, the Yanks beat us hollow. You cannot lift a paper of any description but there they are. They will perhaps excuse me if I burst their little bubble, and remind them of the old axium "That a prophet seldom gets credit from his own countrymen," as the whole of the advertising of the great show is managed by a Glasgow gentlemen, who performed the same function for our own great show in 1888—namely Mr. Charles P. Watson of St. Vincent Street.</p>
