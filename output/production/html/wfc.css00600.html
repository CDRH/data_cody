         <span class="tei_salute">Dear Colonel Cody:</span>
      </span>
      <p class="tei_p">I wish to invite your attention to the fact that this Department has never received a set of the films of the motion pictures taken on the Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota, in the latter part of the year 1913. The Department generally stipulates, before authority is given anyone to take moving pictures on any of the reservations under its jurisdiction, that a positive print of all reels be furnished it.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">A set of these films would be a very valuable acquisition to the Department's collection, particularly because of their historical worth, and as I understand that it is your desire and intention that we have duplicate reels of these pictures, I would appreciate your expediting the delivery of the films.</p>
      <span class="tei_closer">
         <span class="tei_salute">Cordially yours,</span>
