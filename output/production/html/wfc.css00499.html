And as you have to keep men to run the store. If you can <span class="underline">sell</span> anything to advantage how would it do to buy a small stock of goods on <span class="underline">90</span> days time? <a href="../item/wfc.person#goodman.e">Eddy</a> writes he has wholesale prices from different firms. here tofore we have been buying to high. if goods <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="can't​">cant</a> be bought right there will be no <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="profit​">proffit</a>.

We had a series of small things happen on our run to-night; among them was the falling of a brake-rod and a bad flat wheel, which delayed us so that we did not get into town until 6.30 A. M. One-mile haul to lot. Edward C. Wiebe, of the electric-light department, left to-day to join the Augustine Neuville Dramatic Company, at Louisville, Ky. John Curly left again to-night to go to the hospital in Milwaukee. James Rushenberger returned to-day from St. Luke's Hospital, Chicago. Indian Two Dog and wife closed to-day and left for Pine Ridge Agency to-night. M. Coyle, excursion agent and railroad manager, was with us to-day. To-night closes one of the best weeks of the season, so far as a financial basis is considered/ Weather warm, and everything that could be desired. / Business good at both performances. / Lot, Fair Grounds. / Arena, 187 x 363." <a href="#n01.ref"> [back] </a>
