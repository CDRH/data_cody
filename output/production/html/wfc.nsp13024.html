      <p class="tei_p">ACCIDENT AT THE "WILD WEST" SHOW.—At Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show on Saturday afternoon one of the Mexican vaqueros, Johnny Franz, met with a serious accident when breaking in a bucking mustang in the arena. A lasso, thrown to catch the animal's forelegs and bring him to the ground, could round the hind-legs instead, and the mustang, bucking with might and main, ran the rope so quickly through Franz's left hand as to cut it severely. At the London Hospital it was found necessary to put in nine stitches.</p>
