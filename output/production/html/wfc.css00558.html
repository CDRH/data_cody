         <a name="n03.note"> </a>Note 3: Sheedy may be Dennis Sheedy (1846-1923) who, after making a great deal of money raising cattle, entered the banking business as vice president of Colorado National City Bank in 1886, a position that later gave him his connection to Globe Smelting. After helping the company reorganize its finances and create economies of scale, Sheedy led Globe Smelting in increasing its revenues from $200,000 in 1889 to $16 million in 1907. <a href="#n03.ref"> [back] </a>
