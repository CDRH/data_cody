      <p class="tei_p">The Wild West show at the Earl's Court Exhibition is again flourishing exceedingly, and I don't wonder at it. I love it. I get quite childishly excited over the attack on the Deadwood coach, and the marvellous riding of the Indians makes me sick with envy. I used to think I could ride once, but that was before the advent of Buffalo Bill and his merry men. The shooting of the picturesque Colonel Cody and the intrepid <a href="../item/wfc.person#oakley.a">Miss Oakley</a> is as magnificent as ever and everything goes "with a bang"—literally enough, for there is plenty of gunpowder about the performance, and everyone receives a sort of harmless "baptism of fire."</p>
