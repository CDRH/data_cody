And I would not have lost that Town site for $25000 in cash. Oh why did you not do as I asked you to. that was to take up that land. Hymer now claims it all I would like to know what you propose to do— is he going to beat you at every turn in the game? So far he has got the lead— I am watching waiting to see if you give up the game— or are you going to be as cute as he is— I would do some thing. But there is no other location like the one he has surveyed Why did you give him our Surveyors to survey a Town Site<a href="#n03" class="internal_link">3</a> for him self. When we wanted the Town for our selves? I hope you can fix it up. I hate to loose that site— try and let me know soon—</p>
