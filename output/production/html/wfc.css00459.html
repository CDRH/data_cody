      <p class="tei_p">Did <a href="../item/wfc.person#hymer.w">Hymer</a> pay the our engineers for the work they done in surveying the Town Site. If he did we <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="haven't​">havent</a> a leg to stand on. And I would not have lost that Town site for $25000 in cash. Oh why did you not do as I asked you to. that was to take up that land. Hymer now claims it all I would like to know what you propose to do— is he going to beat you at every turn in the game? So far he has got the lead— I am watching waiting to see if you give up the game— or are you going to be as cute as he is— I would do some thing. But there is no other location like the one he has surveyed Why did you give him our Surveyors to survey a Town Site<a name="n03.ref"/>
         <a href="#n03.note" class="ref"> [3] </a> for him self. When we wanted the Town for our selves? I hope you can fix it up. I hate to loose that site— try and let me know soon—</p>
