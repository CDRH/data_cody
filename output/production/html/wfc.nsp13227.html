      <p class="tei_p">Miss <a href="../item/wfc.person#oakley.a">Annie Oakley</a> showed that she would be a formidable opponent in a match at clay pigeons, as she smashed one after another with great precision, and sometimes under the difficult situation of turning her back to the trap, and of laying down her gun and picking it up when the clay saucer was liberated. With the rifle Miss <a href="../item/wfc.person#smith.l">Lillian Smith</a>, the "California Girl," also showed great skill, her best feat being the hitting of a ball made to revolve at the end of a string, like the sham birds at fairs. Pigeon shooters and others may be interested in learning that both of these ladies, as well as Buffalo Bill himself, use the Schultze powder.</p>
