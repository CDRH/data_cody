In a little over two months he rose to first lieutenant. Despite the promotion Armes elected to muster out of the regiment on June 10, 1863.  On July 1, 1863, he accepted a commission at the lower grade of a second lieutenant. Late the next year he resigned to become a captain in the Second New York Artillery, which brought him a brevet (honorary title of recognition but not a permanent rank) as a major of volunteers for gallantry and meritorious service during the campaign of 1864-1865. He left the service on September 29, 1865, but was able to secure an appointment as a second lieutenant in the Second U.S. Cavalry on April 19, 1866.  Within a matter of three months he managed to advance to captain of the Tenth U.S. Cavalry (buffalo soldiers) as commanding officer of Troop I posted to Kansas. It was here Armes met W. F. Cody, who served as a scout and hunted game to supply Armes' troops in the field. The captain admired Cody, who by then had been nicknamed "Buffalo Bill." Not one to pay compliments, Armes nevertheless recollected Cody was "one of our scouts and one of the best shots on the plains… He gets $60 per month and a splendid mule to ride, and is one of the most contented and happy men I ever met." The often contentious captain would be dismissed from the army on June 7, 1870, but reinstated with full back pay and rank of captain on May 11, 1878. He retired September 15, 1883.

            <p class="tei_note">Lewis H. Baker (1869-1931), better known as Johnny Baker, was for many years a fixture in William F. Cody's personal and professional life. As a young boy in North Platte, Nebraska, Baker idolized Cody, who came to look upon Baker as a foster son. Baker accompanied Cody's Wild West on tour from its inception, and was a regular cast member by 1885. Originally billed as the "Cow-Boy Kid," Baker often competed with Annie Oakley in trick shooting contests (consistently won by Oakley), among other roles. Baker remained with the various iterations of the Wild West as long as Cody had an ownership interest in the show. After Cody's death, Baker became one of the chief custodians of the Cody legacy in 1921 as founder of the Buffalo Bill Memorial Museum (now the Buffalo Bill Museum and Grave) in Golden, Colorado. Baker operated the museum until his death in 1931.</p>

For the next decade he served at several frontier posts in that territory as well as in Arkansas and Texas, and formed part of the Utah Expedition of 1857. In 1860 he left the West to conduct recruiting duty, and with the outbreak of the Civil War assumed a staff position with Major General Don Carlos Buell in which capacity he was present at the Battle of Shiloh. After taking part in many key engagements, Bankhead personally witnessed an end to the war at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. The next year Bankhead returned to the West as an officer in the Fifth U.S. Infantry. During that assignment he served at Forts Wallace and Harker in Kansas, posts well known to William F. Cody. Bankhead came to the aid of Major George Alexander Forsyth's besieged command at the Battle of Beecher's Island in 1868. By 1873, as a major of the Fourth U.S. Cavalry, he saw considerable campaigning in Texas and Indian Territory but ended his career under arrest and suspended from rank. On November 12, 1879, he retired "on account of wounds and disability contracted in the line of duty."</p>

In 1868 Bates walked 1,400 miles carrying the American flag through southern states—from Mississippi to Washington, D.C.—for which the neighbor paid him a dollar a day. Bates walked without weapons or money and was met with respect, hospitality, and collegiality all along his march, earning positive publicity.  In 1872 he carried the American flag while trekking through England to prove the existence of friendship between the United States and Great Britain; again he was met with respect and hospitality. Bates became an author and famed guest lecturer, speaking on various social and political issues of the time. Sergeant Bates appeared as the Color-bearer for Buffalo Bill's Wild West during the 1886 and 1887 seasons, presenting the American flag to Queen Victoria at the American Exhibition in London in May 1887.</p>

Although the Shoshone Irrigation Company was not a success, Beck's other investments were profitable, and he became an important local leader in both business and politics. Beck served as mayor of Cody in 1903 and was a Wyoming state senator from 1913 to 1917. He ran unsuccessfully for governor of Wyoming in 1902.</p>

In 1893 he published a biography of Cody entitled <em class="hi">Buffalo Bill from Prairie to Palace</em>, which was timed to coincide with the Wild West's appearance at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

He was among the 24 Indians who departed early from Buffalo Bill's Wild West, sailing from Glasgow aboard the <em class="hi">Corean</em> in early March 1892.  Upon arrival in Chicago, eleven of the Indians returned to Fort Sheridan for incarceration to avoid any chance of reviving the Ghost Dance mania; Charging Thunder and twelve others traveled with George C. Crager to Pine Ridge Reservation. In 1898 Charging Thunder was among those Indians photographed by Gertrude Käsebier in her New York studio. Following his departure from Buffalo Bill's Wild West in 1903, little is known of Charging Thunder, and his death date is unknown.</p>

Her 1920 memoir states that she met William Cody on May 1, 1865, while he was a private in the Seventh Kansas Cavalry on detached duty in St. Louis. The couple married on March 6, 1866. The Codys had four children: daughters Arta (1866-1904), Orra (1872-1883), and Irma (1883-1918), and son Kit Carson Cody (1870-76). The Cody marriage was often strained; with financial disputes, the premature deaths of two children, William Cody's long absences from his family, and his marital infidelities all contributing to the troubles. William Cody twice filed divorce petitions. The first was withdrawn upon the death of Orra Cody in 1883, while the second went to trial in Cheyenne, Wyoming, in 1905. Louisa won the court case, thus, William Cody's petition for divorce was denied. The Codys eventually reconciled after 1910, and Louisa often accompanied William Cody in his travels with the Wild West during the show's final years. After William Cody's death, Louisa published a memoir (co-authored with Courtney Ryley Cooper) entitled <em class="hi">Memories of Buffalo Bill</em>, an account that portrayed her marriage as consistently loving and happy. She died in 1921.</p>

His command suffered a defeat at the Battle of the Rosebud on June 17, 1876, but he obtained somewhat more notable, albeit spotty success in the Apache Wars of the Southwest where he received the nickname "Gray Fox." Crook spent the last part of his life advocating for the fair treatment of American Indians.

After the Civil War he gained a commission as lieutenant colonel of the Seventh U.S. Cavalry regiment. In 1872 he joined Grand Duke Alexis of Russia for an elaborate hunting expedition in the West. The party included Buffalo Bill Cody and Lieutenant General Philip Sheridan.  Four years later, on June 25, 1876, Custer died with much of his command at Little Big Horn, or as the native peoples knew it, the Greasy Grass River. From that day Custer began to transform from an historical figure to a legend, in part because of Cody's Wild West depiction of the fabled "Last Stand" that was performed in front of many thousands of audience members in North America and Europe. </p>

Darrah (1864-1929), a sawmill owner with other business interests in and around the town of Cody, Wyoming, had a history of legal disputes with the Shoshone Irrigation Company. In 1899 Darrah filed a protest against the issuance of land patents for portions of the Shoshone Irrigation Company's Carey Act segregation including the Cody town site, claiming that the Shoshone Irrigation Company had not yet adequately irrigated the area in question. While Darrah's protest was not upheld when adjudicated by government authorities in July 1900, it did delay the acquisition of clear title to these lands by settlers and investors who had filed claims for them. Since the Shoshone Irrigation Company's profitability depended on selling water rights to settlers who expected to gain clear title to the irrigated lands under the Carey Act, protests such as Darrah's were a threat to the business interests of William F. Cody and his partners.</p>

Before the Civil War's conclusion, he had become a major in the Fifteenth U.S. Infantry, and with a reorganization of the army in 1866, served in that grade in the Twenty-fourth U.S. Infantry. Three years later, when another major army reorganization took place, Dudley transferred to the Third U.S. Cavalry, serving with that regiment until a vacancy in the Ninth U.S. Cavalry, a regiment of buffalo soldiers, resulted in his promotion to lieutenant colonel on July 1, 1876. He was post commander at Fort Stanton, New Mexico, as well as the regiment's second in command at the onset of the Lincoln County War (1877-1879), a conflict in which "Billy the Kid" played a dubious role. Dudley, too, came out with a mixed reputation from the part he played in this controversial episode. He fared somewhat better in the campaign against the Apache chief Victorio. Later, on June 6, 1885, he transferred to the First U.S. Cavalry when he received a promotion as the regimental colonel. Dudley retired on August 20, 1889.</p>

He served with the regiment for nearly five years before resigning in 1836 to pursue civil engineering. The formation of the prestigious Corps of Topographical Engineers brought him back to the military in 1838, as a first lieutenant specializing in mapping the United States border, including the Texas-Mexico border and the Gadsden Purchase. Emory also saw action in the Mexican American War at the Battle of San Pasqual, California, in 1847.  Known as an excellent cartographer, topographical engineer, and explorer, Emory became a leading authority on the topography of the trans-Mississippi West. In 1855 he received a promotion to major in the newly formed Second U.S. Cavalry but less than two months later transferred to the First U.S. Cavalry. Emory served with distinction during the Civil War, rapidly advancing as the lieutenant colonel of the Third U.S. Cavalry that would be re-designated as the Sixth U.S. Cavalry.  Early the next year the capable Emory earned his first star as brigade commander in the Army of the Potomac, eventually becoming a major general of volunteers as well as commander of the XIX Corps. Near the end of the war he joined a distinguished list of colonels of the Fifth U.S. during the days when Cody first acted as chief of scouts for the regiment.  Emory later went on to command the Department of the Gulf. On July 1, 1876, he retired as a brigadier general.</p>

In 1882 Tony and his brother Joe (1863-1936) drove cattle from Texas to Wyoming, where their skills with horses caught the attention of William F. Cody, who was assembling his troupe for the first season of the Wild West exhibition. Joe was hired as "chief of cowboys," and Tony was hired as a bucking-horse rider and trick rider. Tony also raced horses, drove the Deadwood Stagecoach, and was proficient in several languages, including Lakota Sioux. Esquivel left Buffalo Bill's Wild West after the 1893 season but rejoined the show for the final European tour in 1902-06.</p>

Within a few months he gained a commission as a first lieutenant in the Eighth Illinois Volunteer Cavalry, and served during the Civil War in the Army of the Potomac as well as later in the Army of the Shenandoah. He eventually attained the rank of brevet (honorary title of recognition but not a permanent rank) brigadier general of volunteers in recognition of "gallant and meritorious service" in such engagements in Virginia as Opequan, Fisher Hill, Middletown, and Five Forks. After the war Forsyth entered the regular army and received a commission as a major in the Ninth U.S. Cavalry (buffalo soldiers). In 1868, at General Philip H. Sheridan's order, Forsyth organized "Forsyth's Scouts," a band of fifty frontiersmen who served as a shock force in the Indian wars in Kansas and Colorado. That same year Forsyth's Scouts fought an engagement against several hundred Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapahoe warriors, which would come to be known as the Battle of Beecher's Island. For this action Forsyth received another brevet as brigadier general, but this time in the U.S. Army.  Forsyth went on to serve as military secretary and aide-de-camp to Sheridan, during which time he participated in Custer's Black Hills expedition of 1874.  Forsyth received the permanent rank of lieutenant colonel in the Fourth U.S. Cavalry in 1881 and retired from the army in 1890.</p>

From there he took on far-flung assignments from Fort Columbus, New York, to Fort Vancouver, Washington, as well as New Orleans Barracks, Fort Brown, Texas, and eventually back to West Point to teach gunnery from 1853 through 1859 as well as serving as the Academy's adjutant for five years. In 1859 he reported to the Artillery School of Practice at Fort Monroe, Virginia. When John Brown raided Harper's Ferry, Fry accompanied Robert E.

When the Civil War began he joined a battery of light artillery in Washington, D.C., but soon assumed temporary duties as an assistant in the adjutant general's department. He left Washington for a staff assignment under Irvin McDowell and spent much of the remainder of the war in similar capacities. Fry's administrative abilities brought him a posting as adjutant general of the Division of the Pacific (December 3, 1866-May 17, 1869), eventually followed by like duties in the Division of the Missouri (June 24, 1871-November 26, 1873), the vast command overseen by Philip H.

            <p class="tei_note">William Selby Harney (1800-1889) was a controversial military figure whose decades in uniform read like a novel. In 1818 he began his military career as a second lieutenant in the First U.S. Infantry. On January 7, 1819, he received his promotion to first lieutenant. Two years later he temporarily transferred to First U.S. Artillery, but would return to his old infantry regiment on December 21, 1822, making captain on May 14, 1825. The ambitious officer left the infantry on May 1, 1833, to become a major in the paymaster department, but not before participating in the sharp, brief Blackhawk War (1832) where Abraham Lincoln also served as a militiaman. On August 15, 1836, Harney returned to the combat arms, in this instance as the lieutenant colonel of the newly established Second U.S. Dragoons.  A decade later he became the regiment's colonel. During his time with the dragoons (the forerunner of the cavalry) he fought in the First Seminole War (1835-1842), the Mexican War (1846-1848), the First Sioux War (1854-1855), as well as serving during the "Bleeding Kansas" period, the Mormon Uprising (1857-1858), and the Civil War as a brigadier general, a rank he held since June 14, 1858. Harney retired from service in 1863 after having been relieved of his command of the Department of the Missouri in part due to perceived Confederate sympathies during the Missouri secession crisis. Harney later returned as a member of the Indian Peace Commission of 1867-1868, and was instrumental in the negotiation of several treaties. </p>

            <p class="tei_note">William Babcock Hazen (1830-1887) graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1855 from where his earliest postings brought him to Texas as a second lieutenant in the Eighth U.S. Infantry. He received his promotion to first lieutenant on April 1, 1861, and advanced to captain just over a month later. Hazen served through the Civil War eventually becoming a major general of volunteers in recognition of "long and continued service of the highest character and for special gallantry… ."  Later Hazen spent time in the American West as colonel of the Thirty-eighth U.S. Infantry, assigned duties such as guarding the construction of the Kansas-Pacific Railroad, which employed W. F. Cody to hunt bison to feed its workers. Hazen negotiated with Cheyenne chief Black Kettle in the days before George Armstrong Custer's November, 1868, attack on the Southern Cheyenne's village along the Washita River in Oklahoma. Hazen became embroiled in controversy with George Custer, publicly criticizing the account of the fight in George Custer's <em class="hi">My Life on the Plains</em>. (New York: Sheldon &amp; Company, 1874). Hazen sailed to Europe as a military observer during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871, and in 1880, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed him brigadier general and chief signal officer of the U.S. Army. He died in 1887 while still in this assignment. </p>

He served in the Union Army during the Civil War and gained publicity after the war for his exploits as a scout, marksman, and professional gambler. He was something of a hero to William F. Cody, who based a number of elements of his public image on Hickok. In 1873 Cody invited Hickok to join the Buffalo Bill Combination, along with John Burwell "Texas Jack" Omohundro (1846-1880), on stage in their new play, <em class="hi">Scouts of the Plains</em>; he left the Combination in March 1874.

Holdrege rose steadily through the company's ranks, holding a series of increasingly responsible posts in Iowa and Nebraska. By 1882, he was general manager of the company's Omaha office. Until his retirement in 1920, Holdrege played a key role in managing the railroad's operations west of the Mississippi. He died in Omaha in 1926.</p>

His first posting took him to the South during Reconstruction in Louisiana then to New York.  King also was twice assigned briefly at West Point as an instructor and went on temporary recruiting duty during 1869. The next year he advanced to first lieutenant while on duty at Fort Hamilton, New York. He sought a transfer to the cavalry which led him to the Fifth U.S. Cavalry on December 30, 1870. It was with this regiment that he met William F. Cody and formed a lifelong bond. Years after their first encounter King would recall in a somewhat embroidered interview with the <em class="hi">St. Paul Dispatch</em>:  "I remember well one night of the 17th of July, on War Bonnet River. I see Bill closing on a superbly accoutered warrior. It is the work of a moment; the Indian has fired and missed; Cody's bullet has torn through the Indian's leg into his horse's heart, and they tumble into a confused heap on the prairie; the chief struggles to his feet for another shot, but Bill's second bullet crashes through the brain and then famous chief Yellow Hand drops lifeless in his tracks, and Buffalo Bill cries, 'The first scalp for Custer!' The Fifth had a genuine affection for Bill. He was a tried and true comrade, one who for cool daring and judgement had no superior. He was a beautiful horseman, an unrivaled shot, and as a scout unequalled. We have tried them all; our western scouts are all noted men in their way. But Buffalo Bill was the Paragon." On June 14, 1879, King retired as captain because of wounds received in the line of duty during the Apache campaigns in Arizona. This situation led to an unlikely turn for King who went on to become a prolific writer with scores of titles to his credit, most of which treated U.S. Army topics. In addition to historical accounts and popular novels, King wrote stage plays and some silent motion picture scripts, even collaborating with Cody in 1913 on the ambitious silver screen production <em class="hi">The Indian Wars</em>. During the course of this project King and Cody had a falling out, but eventually reconciled. Nowhere was their mutual respect more evident than in the fact that as King biographer Don Russell noted:   "Whenever Cody's shows performed in Milwaukee [King's longtime residence], Chicago or Minneapolis, King tried to make at least one performance. After the show the two would go on a drinking spree and inevitably King would suffer physically for the next several days." </p>

            <p class="tei_note">Gordon William Lillie was born in Bloomington, Illinois, in 1860. His family moved to Wellington, Kansas, in the 1870s. In Kansas, Lillie encountered Pawnee Indians en route to reservations in Indian Territory (now part of Oklahoma). Beginning in 1879, Lillie worked as an interpreter and later a teacher for the Pawnee agency. In 1883 Lillie served as a Pawnee interpreter for the first season of Buffalo Bill's Wild West. Lillie later created his own show, Pawnee Bill's Historic Wild West. Lillie was also involved in leading groups of so-called "boomers" (settlers) into parts of present-day Oklahoma as they were opened to white settlement in 1889 and 1893. After 1893 Lillie and his wife May made their off-season home in Pawnee, Oklahoma. Although never as prominent as Buffalo Bill's Wild West, Lillie's show was generally profitable, enabling the Lillies to invest in land, livestock, and oil development ventures in Oklahoma. A long-time admirer of William F. Cody, Lillie formed a partnership with Cody in 1908. Their joint venture was formally known as Buffalo Bill's Wild West Combined With Pawnee Bill's Great Far East, but colloquially as the "Two Bills." Lillie retired from show business after the "Two Bills" show was seized by the sheriff in Denver in 1913 but was able to live comfortably from the proceeds of his investments for the remainder of his life. Pawnee Bill was often billed as "Major" Lillie, but he is not known to have served in the active military. Because "major" was a common courtesy title for U.S. Indian agents in the nineteenth century, Lillie's work on the Pawnee reservation (though not as an actual agent) may have been the basis for his use of the title.</p>

            <p class="tei_note">William M. "Billy" McGinty (January 1, 1871 – May 21, 1961), a diminutive, extraordinarily skilled cowboy from Oklahoma, served as a Private in Troops D and K with Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders in the Spanish-American War. He fought in the Battles of Las Guasimas and San Juan Heights. In 1899, the year following the Spanish American War, veterans of Roosevelt's Rough Riders formed an organization, aptly titled Roosevelt's Rough Rider Association.  McGinty was greatly involved with the Association throughout his life and even served as its President in 1951. He also maintained a friendship with Theodore Roosevelt for years after the war. Part of preserving and bolstering Rough Rider memory came as William F. Cody recruited 16 of Roosevelt's Rough Riders to join Buffalo Bill's Wild West for the 1899 season and beyond. Roosevelt's Rough Riders in the Wild West became part of the Congress of Rough Riders and re-enacted the Battle of San Juan Hill, a martial drama that celebrated the United States victory in Cuba over the Spanish and met tremendous applause at each presentation. McGinty participated as the Color Bearer in the San Juan Hill performance during the 1899 and 1900 seasons.  Upon learning of the act, Theodore Roosevelt wrote to William F. Cody in March 1899, giving his approval for the re-enactment and his soldiers' involvement. He wrote, "I am delighted that McGinty and [Thomas] Isbell are in it. They are thoroughly good men." The San Juan Hill routine was the zenith of the program through the 1901 season when it was replaced by the Battle of Tien-Tsin. McGinty became a world champion bronco rider, led a nationally known cowboy music band, and authored stories on the Spanish American War and western life. His lifetime achievements as a cowboy, Rough Rider, and Wild West performer led to his enshrinement in the National Cowboy Museum's Hall of Great Westerners in 2000.</p>

            <p class="tei_note">Elwood Mead (1858-1936) was a central figure in the history of reclamation projects in the arid West for several decades. Born and raised in Indiana, Mead graduated from Purdue University in 1882 and then received training in civil engineering at Iowa Agricultural College (now Iowa State University). As a faculty member at Colorado State Agricultural College (now Colorado State University), Mead assisted the Colorado state engineer's office and quickly became recognized as an expert in irrigation engineering. Mead was appointed Wyoming territorial engineer in 1888, and was Wyoming's first state engineer, serving until 1899. As such, Mead was intimately involved in the drafting and administration of Wyoming's water laws. Mead's engineering reports on the Shoshone River provided crucial backing for William F. Cody and his partners in the Cody Canal project. After leaving the state engineer's office, Mead served as an irrigation advisor for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and later for the Australian state of Victoria. In 1924, Mead was appointed commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. In that capacity, he oversaw the construction of what is now called Hoover Dam. The reservoir behind Hoover Dam is named Lake Mead in his honor.</p>

It was with this unit that he served as a troop officer for the early part of that conflict. On July 11, 1863, Merritt's leadership skills brought about his promotion from a captain with the Second to a brigadier general of volunteers and by the war's end he wore the two stars of a major general of volunteers. His wartime experience included assignments as aide-de-camp, adjutant, and commander of the Reserve Brigade, First Division, Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac in the Gettysburg campaign. Following the Civil War, Merritt continued to serve in the cavalry along the American frontier starting with his first frontier duties as the lieutenant colonel of the Ninth U.S. Cavalry (buffalo soldiers) in Texas.  On July 1, 1876, he transferred upon his promotion to colonel of the Fifth U.S. Cavalry. Merritt immediately joined the regiment in the field, where on July 17, 1876, he led his men at Warbonnet Creek in a battle that brought W. F. Cody increased fame and became a linchpin of his legend—"The First Scalp for Custer." Afterward Merritt was assigned as chief of cavalry for the Big Horn and Yellowstone expedition in which role he participated in the fighting at Slim Buttes. Not long after these field operations Merritt became superintendent of West Point from 1882 to 1887, and later was appointed brigadier general in the U.S. Army. His promotion to major general came in 1895. At the advent of the Spanish-American War Merritt served as commander of the Department of the East and later, following the Battle of Manila, became the first American military governor of the Philippines. He filled this position for a short time before being relieved to advise the U.S. delegation in the peace negotiations leading to the Treaty of Paris that formally ended hostilities between Spain and the United States. Merritt retired from the Army in 1900.</p>

Miles distinguished himself in combat during the Civil War and was a major general of volunteers by October 1865. Mustered out of volunteer service in 1866, Miles became a colonel in the regular Army. He was an important field commander in several military campaigns against Plains Indians during the 1870s, thus becoming acquainted with William F. Cody, who served as a civilian scout for the Army for much of the decade. Miles was promoted to brigadier general in the regular Army in 1880, major general in 1890, and lieutenant general in 1900. Miles requested Cody's assistance to arrest Sitting Bull in December 1890 during the Ghost Dance crisis, but his orders to Cody were rescinded by authorities in Washington shortly before the Lakota leader was killed by tribal police. Miles was the most senior officer in the U.S. Army from 1895 until his retirement in 1903; he led the U.S. invasion of Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War.

Cody gave Moses a fine set of riding equipment and invited her to a rendezvous in St. Louis at the beginning of the Wild West's 1886 season.  The relationship apparently did not endure.  Moses returned to Morganfield, where she was reported to have fallen into dire poverty by the end of her life.</p>

She gained popularity in the circus world and was soon billed as "the most fearless and dashing horsewoman on earth." Emma Lake Thatcher married fellow circus performer Gilbert Robinson (1845-1928) in 1875 and continued to perform as Emma Lake. In 1876 Emma became step-daughter to James Butler "Wild Bill" Hickok (1837-1876) when her mother married Hickok a few months before his death. Under the show name Emma Lake Hickok, she performed with Buffalo Bill's Wild West in England during 1887-88. Given almost imperceptible cues by their riders, her horses, trained in the style of the Spanish Riding School, jumped to music, stood on hind legs, and bowed to the audience. Emma Lake Thatcher Robinson died in 1911 of injuries sustained from a severe riding accident.</p>

He committed to the Union cause at the outbreak of the Civil War, serving with the Army of the Potomac and holding the rank of major and the brevet (honorary title of recognition but not a permanent rank) rank of colonel by the war's end. Royall served with the Fifth U.S. Cavalry on the western plains through 1875. It was with that regiment that he crossed paths with W. F. Cody, who spent considerable time with this unit as a scout. On December 2, 1875, Royall's promotion to lieutenant colonel brought him to the 3rd U.S. Cavalry, an assignment that placed him at the Battle of Rosebud Creek on June 17, 1876. During the so-called Great Sioux War of 1876-77, in addition to leading the Third, he also commanded five troops of the Second Cavalry. After Ranald S. McKenzie relinquished his command of the Fourth U.S. Cavalry in 1882, Royall rose to colonel of that regiment. In 1887 Royall retired with the rank of brigadier general.</p>

Kicking Bear and Short Bull became the principal leaders of the Ghost Dance religion among the Sioux at Pine Ridge and Standing Rock Agencies. In order to calm the unrest following the Wounded Knee Massacre, Short Bull and other Native men and women were imprisoned in Fort Sheridan, Illinois. Many of these prisoners, including Short Bull and Kicking Bear, were released from jail and contracted by Buffalo Bill's Wild West to perform in Europe for the season 1891-92.

A veteran of the Great Sioux War and Little Big Horn, Sitting Bull resisted American encroachment into the West and continued fighting against Americans until he surrendered in 1881. Sitting Bull joined the Wild West Exhibition in 1885 in Buffalo, New York, after William Cody spent nearly two years trying to recruit him. As perhaps the most well-known Indian in America as both a survivor of Little Big Horn and a symbol of Indian resistance to westward expansion, the chance to sign Sitting Bull would only serve to increase Cody's prestige and generate publicity for the Wild West. Sitting Bull toured with Buffalo Bill's Wild West for only four months. Having grown tired of the travel and bustling cities, he decided to return to his home on Pine Ridge. In 1890 Indian agent James McLaughlin sent Indian police to arrest Sitting Bull. Shooting erupted and Sitting Bull was killed in the skirmish. Sitting Bull's son and six other Hunkpapas died, as did six policemen.</p>

It is unclear whether Tait actually saw combat with the Rough Riders.

However, William F. Cody's letters to Tait in the last few years of Cody's life show that Cody considered Tait a trusted friend and that Tait knew much about Cody's business affairs. Tait is listed as a member of Buffalo Bill's Wild West in route books for the 1899 and 1902 seasons; it is likely that Tait may have performed for Buffalo Bill's Wild West in other seasons as well.

            <p class="tei_note">Harry Heye Tammen was born in Baltimore in 1856. At the age of 21, he was a bartender at the Palmer House, a leading Chicago hotel. He was head bartender at the Windsor Hotel in Denver by 1895, when he joined Frederick G. Bonfils as co-owner of the <em class="hi">Denver Post</em>. Bonfils and Tammen built the newspaper into a commercial success by practicing a highly sensationalistic brand of "yellow" journalism. The partners collaborated in other business ventures including the <em class="hi">Kansas City Post</em> (1909-1922) and the Sells-Floto Circus (1904-1921), although it appears that Tammen was the more active partner in the latter. In 1913 Tammen engineered the collapse of William F. Cody's show business partnership with Gordon W. "Pawnee Bill" Lillie by orchestrating the local sheriff's seizure of the show's physical assets due to debts owed to a printing company controlled by Tammen. Tammen then used Cody's personal debt as leverage to ensure Buffalo Bill's appearances with the Sells-Floto Circus for the 1914 and 1915 show seasons. Tammen and Bonfils were important financial backers of Cody's motion picture project in late 1913. By 1915 Tammen's relationship with Cody was badly frayed, as Cody was exasperated with his business practices. Although Cody stopped touring with the Sells-Floto Circus at the conclusion of the 1915 season, Tammen did his best to maximize his own profits from Cody's name for as long as he could. Tammen died in 1924.</p>

Six-foot-five-inches tall, Taylor was featured for his horsemanship skills.</p>

            <p class="tei_note">After attending Yale Law School, Alfred Howe Terry (1827-1890) briefly practiced law before being appointed clerk of the Superior Court of New Haven, Connecticut. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he raised a regiment of volunteers for the Union Army and served with distinction in the eastern theater. After the war, Terry opted for a career in the military, ultimately rising to the rank of major general. During Terry's service as military commander of the Department of Dakota from 1866-1869 and again from 1872-1886, he was involved in negotiating the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, commanded the Dakota Column in the summer 1876 campaign of the Great Sioux War, and served as an envoy to Canada in October 1877, in an attempt to negotiate Sitting Bull's return to the United States. In 1886 Terry was promoted to major general and became commander of the U.S. Army's Great Plains forces, two years before his retirement and four years before his death. </p>

After serving in the Union army during the Civil War, Wiley entered business as a hydraulic engineer and contractor.  In 1876, Wiley moved to Omaha, Nebraska, where he managed companies that provided water service and electric lighting to city residents.  In Wyoming, Wiley's Big Horn Basin Development Company undertook two significant irrigation ventures.  The Bench Canal, begun in the 1890s and completed by 1907, diverted water from the Greybull River to irrigate an area then known as Germania Bench (the name was later changed to Emblem Bench due to anti-German sentiment during World War I).  The town of Germania (now Emblem) in Big Horn County was a result of this successful project. Much less successful were Wiley's attempts to irrigate the area called Oregon Basin with water from the Shoshone River and to found a town (called Wiley) about twelve miles southeast of Cody.  The Big Horn Basin Development Company was unable to complete the necessary canal and went into receivership in 1908.  Solon Wiley lost much of his personal fortune in the process, and left the Basin to return to Omaha.  The town of Wiley soon disappeared.</p>

At the age of 12 he began his cowboy career tending stock at area ranches and developing strong skills as a rider, roper, animal trainer, and scout—eventually becoming an outrider for the Deadwood Stage. In 1885 Willoughby joined Buffalo Bill's Wild West and was promoted as "Champion Roper of Wyoming." In early 1887 Willoughby wed Lillian Francis Smith at Staten Island, New York, and they both departed for England with Buffalo Bill's Wild West, performing before Queen Victoria at the American Exhibition of 1887. By early 1889 the marriage had ended when Smith left Willoughby for another cowboy performer. Willoughby started his own wild west show in 1893 but by 1911 was in California under contract as a film actor with the Fine Arts Film Company. Jim 'Kid' Willoughby appeared in silent films with such actors as Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., Harry Gant, Al Jennings, and Harry Carey. Willoughby's sister Mollie was married for a time to George C. Crager, interpreter for the American Indians with Buffalo Bill's Wild West. James W. "Jim Kid" Willoughby died of pneumonia on December 9, 1916.</p>

The vision foresaw the resurrection of the Paiute dead, the removal of all whites, and the full restitution of all lands to the tribes. In order to achieve this vision, Wovoka preached that all Native Americans must live righteously and without violence and perform the round dance known as the Ghost Dance—preachings largely based in Christianity. Distorted views of his teachings are believed to have precipitated the Wounded Knee Massacre in December 1890. Following this event, Wovoka lost his prominence and lived the remainder of his life as Jack Wilson.</p>
