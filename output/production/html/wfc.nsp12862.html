      <p class="tei_p">The antics of a buck-jumper are intensely amusing to the lookers-on, and certainly the steeds supposed to be fiery and untamed which have been bucking and kicking their way round the ring at the Wild West have been highly popular. But are they real buck-jumpers, or only cleverly trained "trick-horses"? We ask the question merely from a thirst for information. It has been presumed that they were the genuine article; but we observe that the huge posters in the streets announcing the sale of Colonel Cody's horses say nothing about buck-jumpers. But there is something about horses "warranted free from vice."</p>
