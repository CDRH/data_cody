      <p class="tei_p">IN addition to the London Lord Mayor's Show on the 9th of November the inhabitants of the Capital may possibly have the opportunity of witnessing this month a procession of a more novel character. At a presentation which was made by some working men to Buffalo Bill the other night, it was suggested that the Home Secretary should allow Colonel Cody on leaving Earl's Court to take his troupe through London. There is no doubt that the multitude, with whom Buffalo Bill is a prime favourite, will be gratified if Mr. Asquith can see his way to act on the suggestion. Moreover, if, as it is generally believed, the Home Secretary is going to throw open Trafalgar Square to demonstrations of all sorts, there seems no particular reason why the "Wild West Show" should not be allowed to perambulate the streets on the occasion of its supposed final departure to the States.</p>
