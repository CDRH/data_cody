      <p class="tei_p">Buffalo Bill was not only a purveyor of amusement: he was really a national character, his work significant of certain historical phases which have passed.  "The Adventures of Buffalo Bill," a feature presenting the late Col. William F. Cody in a historically accurate picturization of his thrilling life, will be released by Essanay the latter part of this month.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Five thousand United States troops and Indians engage in battles on the sites of the great frontier battlefields where "Buffalo Bill" won his fame.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The value of pictures as a means of preserving the visual personality of famous characters is only just beginning to be felt.  What would we not give for a glimpse of Washington, of Lincoln, of others as famous and beloved?</p>
