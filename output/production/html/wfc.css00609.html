      </span>
      <p class="tei_p">Referring to my several communications, and to the interview had with you a day or two ago by a representative of the Department, relative to the matter of securing a set of moving picture films of scenes taken on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation during the year 1913, I am forwarding herewith for your information a copy of a letter just received from the Essanay Company.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">You will observe that the company claims to have no knowledge of any arrangement by which this Department would receive a set of the reels, and it would appear, therefore, that the Department will have to rely on you to straighten out the matter, which you heretofore so kindly promised to do.</p>
