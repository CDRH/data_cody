      <p class="tei_p">I think the Horticultural and Buffalo Bill Redivivus Show will "catch on." No exhibition must be judged by its opening day; but if the weather this summer proves only fairly decent, and if the managers carry out their ideas at present in embryo, I don't see why the Earl's Court show should not hold its own, even against the tremendous counter-attraction of Venice in London. I don't think Colonel Cody has made enough in the advertisements of the fact that a great many of his Indians took part in the very natural rising against Yankee fraud which took place last year, and in which so many of the unfortunate Aborigines met their death—men, women, and children being mercilessly shot down in an indiscriminate butchery.</p>
