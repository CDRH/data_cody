      <p class="tei_p">THE WILD WEST SHOW AT COATBRIDGE AND AIRDRIE.—Yesterday we had a call from Mr Joseph H. Hart, representative of Col. Cody (Buffalo Bill) of the Wild West Show, who is here trying to make arrangements for a grand concert in Coatbridge and Airdrie by the celebated Cowboys' Band, the Tyrolean singers, and possibly a strong representation of the Indians.—Should this be successful, due notice of particulars will be given next week.</p>
