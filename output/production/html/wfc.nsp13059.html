      <p class="tei_p">"Buffalo Bill's" audience on Saturday afternoon included a large party under the auspices of the London Working Men's Association, who after the show assembled in the tea room of the exhibition to bid Cody good-bye. Mr. George Potter, president of the association, and Mr. F. Whetstone made a few remarks, and an address was presented to "Buffalo Bill," who thanked his visitors heartily for their kindness.</p>
