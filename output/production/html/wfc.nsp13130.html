      <p class="tei_p">BUFFALO BILL'S WILD WEST.—On Saturday afternoon a number of representatives of the London Working Men's Association visited Buffalo Bill's "Wild West" to see the last of that entertainment and to wish good-bye to Col. Cody. After the performances the party assembled in the tea-room of the International Horticultural Exhibition, where Col. Cody and his partner, Mr. <a href="../item/wfc.person#salsbury.n">Nate Salsbury</a>, and Major <a href="../item/wfc.person#burke.j">J. M. Burke</a> were present. Mr. George Potter, president of the association, occupied the chair, and spoke on behalf of the working men present, as did also Mr. F. Whetstone, the vice-president, and an address neatly framed and handsomely illuminated was presented to Colonel Cody, who thanked his visitors heartily for their kindness and attention, saying that he would always remember with pleasure the interest and support which he had received from the working men of London. He regretted, however, that he would be unable to remain longer with his present visitors, owing to an appointment which he then had with his medical adviser, but that he hoped to see them all again previous to his final departure on Oct. 12.</p>
