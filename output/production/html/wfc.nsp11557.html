      <p class="tei_p">BIRTH AT THE WILD WEST CAMP.—Yesterday, in the Indian camp at the Wild West Show, the squaw of <a href="../item/wfc.person#little.chief">Little Chief</a>, (who ranks next to <a href="../item/wfc.person#shirt.r">Red Shirt</a>) gave birth in the morning to a female child. This is the first birth which has taken place during the sojourn of the Indians in this country. A council was held in camp during the day, and the name quickly decided upon—Frances Victoria Alexandra—in honour of Mrs. Cleveland,<a name="n01.ref"/>
         <a href="#n01.note" class="ref"> [1] </a>
         <a href="../item/wfc.person#victoria.q">Queen Victoria</a>, and the Princess of Wales.<a name="n02.ref"/>
         <a href="#n02.note" class="ref"> [2] </a> The Indians celebrated the event with the rejoicings usual on such an occasion, and <a href="../item/wfc.person#burke.j">Major Burke</a> telegraphed the news to Red Cloud, the great chief of the Sioux Indians at Pine Ridge Agency. A child of Little Chief died last summer in London, and was buried at West Brompton Cemetery. The papoose and mother are doing well.</p>
