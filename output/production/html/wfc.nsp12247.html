      <p class="tei_p">The "Wild West" and the International Horticultural Exhibition are advertised as "A Mecca for the holidays." Buffalo Bill will give a morning performance in the arena today, in addition to the afternoon and evening exhibitions. The Indians, cowboys, and vacqueros are now added to by the Cossacks of the Caucasus, who run the sons of the prairie hard in wild riding. Only three more days have to run of the engagement of the band of the Garde Republicaine of France, but the Grenadier Guards' Band will continue to discourse their music. Pilgrims to this Mecca will therefore be repaid for any tribulation they may encounter <em class="hi">en route.</em>
