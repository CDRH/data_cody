      <p class="tei_p">All who have not seen Buffalo Bill's Wild West, and those who would once more witness the most unique exhibition of this or any other age, should lose no time, as the last performance is fixed for Oct. 12, and the company will sail for America on the <em class="hi">Mohawk</em> on Saturday. Oct. 15. This is really the last time Buffalo Bill will bring his show to England, so hurry up, good friends.</p>
