      <p class="tei_p">OF skilful marksmen, London is at present crowded, but to Miss <a href="../item/wfc.person#oakley.a">Annie Oakley</a>, of Wild West fame, must the palm be awarded. This young lady is, perhaps, the most clever female exponent of the noble art of shooting that the world has ever seen, and her performance must be seen to be appreciated. The ease and rapidity with which she smashes up glass balls is really wonderful, and intending candidates amongst Volunteers for Bisley honours could do worse than take lessons from her. Annie is in no way conceited of her talent, but is one of the most unaffected, good natured girls conceivable.</p>
