      <p class="tei_p">CLOSE OF THE WILD WEST SHOW. —After a successful run of fifteen weeks, "Buffalo Bill's" Wild West show has been brought to a close. Up till the last the show maintained its power of attraction. Two performances were given last Saturday, and on both occasions the vast building was well filled. In the expression of their appreciation of the various scenes and performances the audience were exceptionally hearty, the extra warmth of demonstration being doubtless intended to convey a cordial farewell. In the absence of "Buffalo Bill" (Colonel Cody), the final bow to the public of the city was made at the close of the evening representation by Master <a href="../item/wfc.person#baker.l">Johnnie Baker</a>, his adopted son.</p>
