  <span class="tei_salute">Dear Captain.</span>

      </span>

      <p>I presume you were informed by the Interior Dept.<a href="#n01" class="internal_link">1</a> that I have permission for Indians. I am writing Shangrau. <a href="#n02" class="internal_link">2</a> And I don't wish to commence looking up Indians. Until I have your permission so if you see Shangrau will you please speak to him about it. I will not want the Indians much before May.  but its well to be letting them know. I will try my best to come after them my self—</p>


      <span class="tei_closer">
         <span class="tei_salute">With my best wishes</span>
         <span class="tei_salute">Yours truly</span>
