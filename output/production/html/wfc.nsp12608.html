      <p class="tei_p">The other afternoon I met Sarah Bernhardt. She was with her little five-year-old niece, a dear little child, not a bit precocious, which is the more wonderful as she has already made her <em class="hi">début</em> on the stage. She is thoroughly fresh, of course. Her aunt had taken her the day before to see Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. The little one chatted away at a marvellous rate of all the wonderful things she had seen there. She and Sarah Bernhardt had gone quite alone.</p>
