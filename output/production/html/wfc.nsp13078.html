      <p class="tei_p">The announcement that the "Wild West" Show at Earl's Court will close shortly has had a marked effect on the attendance. Probably at no season at Earl's Court have there been larger gatherings of visitors than those during the last two or three weeks. The Horticultural Exhibition at one end of the Exhibition buildings cannot be said to have proved a great attraction, but the excellent music provided in the grounds has amply compensated for any deficiency in that respect. It has been decided that the performances of Colonel Cody and his Indian braves, Cossacks, and cowboys shall terminate on the 12th prox., and that the sale of the large stud of horses used in the performances, excluding the vicious ones (the "buck-jumpers") shall commence on the following day. The Deadwood Coach will not be offered for sale, neither of course will the buffaloes. The animals just mentioned are too scarce nowadays to be readily parted with.</p>
