      <p class="tei_p">Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay is dead—dead as a doornail—and not all the king's horses, nor all the king's men, will put it on its legs again. Not the song; that goes on as merrily as ever, notwithstanding the tale told by the thermometer of 135 degrees of sunshine; but the fiery untamed steed of that name, which formed one of the attractions of the Wild West. The animal was one of the best buck-jumpers, and while going through its performance yesterday afternoon, jumped and pirouetted to such an extent that it kicked itself heels over head and fell heavily with its rider. The cowboy saved himself by admirable agility, but Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay broke his neck and kicked no more.</p>
