Mr. C. E. Perkins,

<span class="tei_salute">Dear Sir:</span>
      </span>

      <p>Yours as to Basin Line just at hand.  Mr. Calvert and our Engineers doubt the feasibility of “going into” Cody without an increase in expense and grade that would not be warranted.</p>

      <p>We decided for this reason to run preliminary lines both sides of the river, and as soon as a report giving the needed facts can be made, we shall submit the question to you.  This I think we can do perhaps in 6 to 12 days.</p>

      <span class="tei_closer">
         <span class="tei_salute">Your respectfully,</span>
         <span class="tei_signed">G. W. Holdrege.</span>
      </span>
