      <p class="tei_p">As promised inlast week's SHOOTING TIMES, we now reproduce two more illustrations from Mr. Langan's <em class="hi">Wild West Review</em>; the illustrations are by Mr. Charles Henckel. The <em class="hi">Review</em> says:—</p>

         <h4>"SHORT BULL"</h4>
         <p class="tei_p">"<a href="../item/wfc.person#short.bull">Short Bull</a>," High Priest to the Messiah, and leader of the great "Ghost-Dance" which caused the outbreak in the winter of 1890 91; still a prisoner of war; 41 years old, and of very fine feature (considering he is an Indian), comes of good fighting stock. His father was a noted warrior in the campaigns of the Siouxs against the Crows, Pawnees, Blackfeet, and other tribes. The subject of our sketch has been many times arrayed against the Government, and in the last campaign was the one (with his brother warrior, "<a href="../item/wfc.person#kicking.bear">Kicking Bear</a>") to surrender. He is a great leader among the young warriors, brave yet diplomatic. He held his stronghold in the Bad Lands of the Black Hills against an invading army like a true general. His knowledge of the white race and their strength has been greatly increased since his tour with "Buffalo Bill's" Wild West began last March (1891), and we trust he will, in future, be content "to roam no more."</p>

         <p class="tei_p">The knack of stooping thus, to pick up objects from the ground, is one very easily acquired, but absolutely impossible of execution, except with a high-pummelled saddle, such as the Cow-boys and the Cossacks use. We have, personally, been <em class="hi">there,</em> and we know what is what, and what we are talking about.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">As to riding buckers, the plan is <em class="hi">not</em> to sit the horse squarely, but to let the right thigh rest on the saddle, and thus take off the jar from the bucking. In one word, the right leg <em class="hi">plays,</em> gives way to the jerks, and the rest is easy.</p>
