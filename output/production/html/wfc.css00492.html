         <a name="n01.note"> </a>Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Kenton, Ohio, on July 8, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "Kenton, Ohio. / Wednesday, July 8. Arrived in town at 6 A. M. Three-quarters mile haul to lot, which we found to be large and roomy and in good condition. R. F. Watson, an American soldier, had a saber run through his left ear during the military drill. While Engineer C. H. Crowell was down-town this morning he was arrested on suspicion of being connected with a $900.00 robbery; he was taken to headquarters, searched and let go. Reserve seats were sold to-day for 25 cents each for the first time this season. William Sloan, second cook, closed to-day. / Business in the afternoon big, in the evening fair. / Lot, Liston and Fountain streets. / Arena, 179 x 366." <a href="#n01.ref"> [back] </a>
