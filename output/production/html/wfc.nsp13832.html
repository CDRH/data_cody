      <h3>AN ACCIDENT AT THE WILD WEST SHOW.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">On Friday afternoon a serious accident occurred at the Wild West Show at Trent Bridge. As <a href="../item/wfc.person#oakley.a">Miss Annie Oakley</a> was commencing her performance in the arena, one of the stands collapsed, carrying a large number of people with it to the ground. The greatest excitement prevailed, it being feared that many had been badly injured, but fortunately the stand fell towards the rising, so that most of the occupants descended pretty easily to the ground. Miss Oakley's nerve and coolness saved a panic as she went through her performance without missing a shot.</p>
