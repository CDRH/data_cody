   <div class="note">Note 1: BBWW performed in Cortland, New York, on September 16, 1895.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: "Hillsberry" refers to Laban Hillberry (or Labin Hillsberry), a prospector who was looking for investors in a water development project in the Big Horn Basin in 1893 when he met George Beck. Hillberry encouraged Beck to explore the potential for diverting water from the South Fork of the "Stinking Water" (Shoshone River) to irrigate the area. Beck then sent Jerry Ryan to evaluate the country for him; Ryan's report encouraged Beck to seriously consider the Big Horn Basin.</div>
