      <p class="tei_p">I wonder if it has ever struck you, as it has repeatedly struck me, how very easily we might all be struck as we sit around gazing at Buffalo Bill's Wild West Circus. I mean in this way. You know a vast deal of shooting takes place, and in the case of the glass-ball breakers, shot-cartridges are used. When the Indians and cowboys fight and exchange many shots, they, of course, do so with blank cartridges. Well, what I want to know is, where we should all be if by chance the gentleman who hands out the ammunition to the Indians and cowboys made a mistake, put his hand into the wrong box, and served out shot-loaded cartridges? Stranger things than that have happened at sea, you know!</p>
