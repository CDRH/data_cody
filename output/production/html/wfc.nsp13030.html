      <p class="tei_p">Richmond was much interested in the visit of Bill Cody's "Injuns" last Sunday. About fifty of them promenaded the Terrace during "Church Parade," and afterwards embarked at Messum's for a row on the river, returning later on to their native tents on foreign shores, <em class="hi">i.e.,</em> West Brompton.</p>
