      <p class="tei_p">"Colonel" Cody, more familiarly known as Buffalo Bill, with his troupe of cowboys, Indians, &amp;c., has returned to his old quarters at Earl's Court, and is giving two performances daily in the arena. The horses are just as wild and the cowboys just as energetic as heretofore, while a herd of buffalo is an attraction newly added. The main building, which on the occasion of Buffalo Bill's last visit was the scene of the American Exhibition, is now filled with an International Horticultural Exhibition, the greater part of it being laid out as a flower garden with gravel paths. A cleverly painted background gives the idea of space and picturesque surrounding country.</p>
