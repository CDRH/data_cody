      <p class="tei_p">The veteran Mrs. Keeley paid a visit the other day to Buffalo Bill's "Wild West," and was greatly pleased with the show. "I am an old actress," she said to Col. Cody afterwards, "but I have never seen such real acting in my life as I have seen this afternoon." She also told the colonel that she had played in New York in 1836—56 years ago. That she is still hale and hearty is shown by the fact that she tripped up the stairs leading to the colonel's tent as lightly and gracefully almost as a girl of seventeen. </p>
