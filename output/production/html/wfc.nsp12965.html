W. F. Cody) that he and his unique troupe of horsemen were commanded to Windsor Castle on Saturday, for the purpose of giving before the Queen and Court and a brilliant assemblage of distinguished visitors the main features of the entertainment now being given by him daily with so much success at the Horticultural Exhibition at Earl's Court.</p>
