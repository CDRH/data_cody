   <div class="note">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Columbia, South Carolina, on October 26, 1901.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: The papers Cody mentions could have dealt with lands he leased from the state of Wyoming, or with either of his two Big Horn Basin irrigation projects: the Cody Canal and the Cody-Salsbury Canal.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 3: Another letter from William F. Cody to Hinkle, also dated October 26, 1901, includes an invitation for Hinkle to join Cody on this hunting trip.  Buffalo Bill's Wild West gave its last performance of the 1901 season on October 28.  Cody often came to the Big Horn Basin for hunting trips at the conclusion of the show season.</div>
