      <h3>Buffalo Bill's Riders.</h3>
      <span class="tei_lg">
         <span class="tei_lg">
            <span class="tei_l">Hurrah for Buffalo Bill and his band!</span>
            <span class="tei_l"> For they've captured the seven-hill'd city,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">And his cowboys have made Rome howl with delight,</span>
            <span class="tei_l"> And his braves carol the war-whoop ditty.</span>
            <span class="tei_l">For the wild Roman horses, that no one could tame</span>
            <span class="tei_l"> Or ride, as a matter of fact,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">In their hands are subdued from foot to mane—</span>
            <span class="tei_l"> Thanks to the Western boys' courage and tact.</span>
         </span>
         <span class="tei_lg">
            <span class="tei_l">For the dukes, lords and ladies of high deree,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">The Pope, Cardinals, Bishops—all, all come to see</span>
            <span class="tei_l">The Wild West Show of Buffalo Bill.</span>
            <span class="tei_l">His cowboy daring and wonderful skill.</span>
         </span>
         <span class="tei_lg">
            <span class="tei_l">For no one in Rome, whether absent or present,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">From the highest in the land to the lowliest peasant,</span>
            <span class="tei_l"> Their wild horses could tame or ride or astride,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Until Buffalo Bill's boys dashing along came,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Putting at once all other horsemen to shame</span>
            <span class="tei_l">And, with the breezy coolness of the Western slope,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Tamed them at once, right in sight of the Pope!</span>
         </span>
         <span class="tei_lg">
            <span class="tei_l">Then hurrah for Buffalo Bill and his boys!</span>
            <span class="tei_l">For the wild horses of Rome to them are but toys!</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Ah! the cowboys of the West know nothing of fear,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">And the welkin will ring with cheer upon cheer</span>
            <span class="tei_l">When they return once again to "Home, Sweet, Home."</span>
            <span class="tei_l">And tell of their wonderful "Ride in Rome!"</span>
