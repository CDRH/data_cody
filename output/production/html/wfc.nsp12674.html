      <p class="tei_p">Anent curtain calls, a very funny thing occurred within my experience when I was leading man with a lady star in a society drama four or five years ago. It was at the time when Colonel Cody had just concluded his first visit to England with the Wild West, and we were playing in a large northern seaport whence on the following day he was set to sail. Just as the curtain had fallen on the third act there came a terrific burst of applause, and, picking herself out of my arms with, "Oh, there's a lovely call; come and take it quick!" the lady ran to the prompt corner. I led her in front of the act-drop, when I noticed, to my utter astonishment, that everyone in the audience was gazing up at the circle and applauding vigorously. I don't think half a dozen noticed our presence in front of the curtain at all, and we retired in wonderment. It transpired that Buffalo Bill, who, of course, was the hero of the hour, had just entered the theatre, and, being "spotted," was accorded the hearty reception which we had mistaken for a flattering call.</p>
