      <p>Note: Exact year not known with certainty, though 1885 appears likely since Cody makes reference to Arta visiting him in St. Louis where BBWW appeared October 3-11, 1885.  MS6 has the year question-marked as 1882, but that date is unlikely since the Combination was in Iowa on September 28, 1882. The added '5' entered in pencil is not WFC's handwriting and may have been entered later.</p>
