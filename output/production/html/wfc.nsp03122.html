      <p class="tei_p">LONDON, Aug 25.â€”Meagre details have just been received here of a fight between the cowboy and Indian companies of Buffalo Bill and <a href="../item/wfc.person#carver.w">Dr. Carver</a> in the streets of Hamburg.<a name="n01.ref"/>
         <a href="#n01.note" class="ref"> [1] </a> It is understood that a fierce conflict took place, and that but for the interference of the police in force life would have been taken. Nothing else is talked of.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Dr. Carver's company is but lately away from Ruseia, where in Moscow it had great trouble with the police, when blood was shed.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">For a long time there had been great rivalry between Dr. Carver and Buffalo Bill. The latter opened his show in Hamburg yesterday.</p>
