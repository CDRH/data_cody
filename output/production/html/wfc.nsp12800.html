      <p class="tei_p">On Thursday last Col. Cody commemorated the 200th performance of the "Wild West" show by presenting his visitors with a well-executed photo of himself. September is upon us, and we shall, before very long, have a return to town of the numerous holiday-makers. To them there is no more attractive show than Buffalo Bill's and the Exhibition Gardens and bands, which should be crowded to excess almost. The attendances are increasing already, and up till now it may be interesting to readers to know that the excellence of the exhibition is testified to by the attendance, which has reached the total of 1,400,000, as registered by the turnstiles. Buffalo Bill's Wild West is nearing its close, so don't forget to hurry up and see it, for it is better now than it has ever been.</p>
