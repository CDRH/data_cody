      <h3>THE ANT-HOUSE AT THE SHRUBBERIES.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">The ant-house at the International Horticultural Exhibition is now very popular. The practice of holding an ant under a microscope has been discontinued on the ground of cruelty. An excellent descriptive pamphlet on the working ants has been published at the exhibition.</p>
