      <h3>EXHIBITIONS.</h3>
      <h3>The International Horticultural Exhibition.</h3>
      <h3>BUFFALO BILL'S "WILD WEST."</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">MR. <a href="../item/wfc.person#burke.j">JOHN M. BURKE</a>, general manager of Buffalo Bill's "Wild West," writes as follows:—"In view of the early departure (forever) of this natural Exhibition, and the fact of an apparent disbelief on the part of the public of this being a farewell, I would esteem it a favour if, in your earliest issue, you would call attention to and impress the same on your readers. An affair of this magnitude needs the hearty support of the public, and having in view its educational value, the interest added to the study of racial character and form, as well as horsemanship, I feel justified in making this request. The last performance of the 'Wild West' will take place on October 12, the company sailing on s.s. <em class="hi">Mohawk,</em> on Saturday, October 15. On behalf of Messrs. Cody and <a href="../item/wfc.person#salsbury.n">Salsbury</a>, accept thanks for past generous treatment of our subject, leaving it to the reviewer of the future, and hoping we have added something of merit to the exhibitions of the decade."</p>
