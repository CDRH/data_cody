      <p class="tei_p">BUFFALO BILL'S collection of horsemen probably present the finest combined display of horsemanship that has ever been seen. In addition to the Indians, Cowboys, Mexicans, Vacqueros, and what-not, of the earlier days of the Exhibition, a band of Cossacks from the Caucasus has recently been added, and, to make a strong show still stronger, a number of Gauchos from the South American Pampas, hard and fearless riders from a semi-savage region, are now introduced into the arena to cope in friendly rivalry with the other daring horsemen. On Friday last this strangest of gatherings journeyed to Windsor and went through their remarkable evolutions in the presence of the Queen, returning subsequently by special train to their quarters at the Horticultural Exhibition at Earl's Court.</p>
