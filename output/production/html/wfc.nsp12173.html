      <p class="tei_p">A STRANGE CONGREGATION AT ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL.—There was a curious sight at St. Paul's Cathedral last Sunday morning. All the Sioux Indians, Mexicans, cowboys, and the recently-arrived Cossacks who are part of Buffalo Bill's troupe, were at the morning service. It is said that more attention was paid to them than to the service. It was a strange meeting of red men from the Far West and Russians from Eastern Europe, sitting altogether and apparently devoutly attending to a service which they could not possibly have understood. The Indians were greatly impressed by the service (though a few of them looked bored before the thing was over), and particularly charmed by the music of the big organ. To this moment they cannot be made to understand where the sound came from, and how it was produced. As the party entered and left in a body, were shown to three consecutive rows of seats, and were under police escort, the visit must have been arranged.</p>
