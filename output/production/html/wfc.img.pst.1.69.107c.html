            Buffalo Bill to the rescue, 4-color lithograph. The Deadwood stage became the most recognizable object in the Wild West. This scene of the stage being attacked by Indians with Buffalo Bill leading the cavalry to the rescue was replayed at every performance of the Wild West show throughout its 30-year history.
