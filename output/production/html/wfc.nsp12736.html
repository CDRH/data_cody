      <h3>A ROMANTIC MARRIAGE.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">The American papers announce that a marriage has just taken place between the daughter of <a href="../item/wfc.person#sitting.bull">Sitting Bull</a>, the famous Sioux chief who was killed last year in a combat with the Federal troops, and Mr. Markle, a German-American citizen. It appears that the young Indian saved Mr. Markle's life when he was taken captive in one of Sitting Bull's expeditions against the white settlers. The marriage took place at Randout, in the State of New York.</p>
