      <h3>Letter from Buffalo Bill.</h3>
      <h3>He Gives an Entertaining Description of His London Experience.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">The El Paso Inter-Republics of July 7 contains the following:</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Colonel William Roy<a name="n01.ref"/>
         <a href="#n01.note" class="ref"> [1] </a> of this city, an old friend and comrade of Buffalo Bill, is in receipt of a frank and characteristic letter from the great scout. It shows conclusively that he is the same Bill, howe'er fortune has smiled. The letter runs as follows:</p>

            <span class="tei_dateline">LONDON, June 23, 1887.</span>
         </span>
         <p class="tei_p">My Dear Colonel--It was a genuine pleasant surprise to receive your letter. I have often thought of you and wondered what had become of you. So glad you are still on top of the earth. Well, ever since I got out of the mud hole in New Orleans,<a name="n02.ref"/>
            <a href="#n02.note" class="ref"> [2] </a> things have been coming my way pretty smooth and I have captured this country from the queen down, and am doing them to the tune of $10,000 a day. Talk about show business, there never was anything like it ever known and never will be again, and, with my European reputation, you can easily guess the business I will do when I get back to my own country.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">It's pretty hard work with two and three performances a day and the society racket, receptions, dinners, etc. No man, not even Grant,<a name="n03.ref"/>
            <a href="#n03.note" class="ref"> [3] </a> was received better than your humble servant. I have dined with every one of the royalty from Albert, Prince of Wales, down. I sometimes wonder if it is the same old Bill Cody, the bull whacker. Well, colonel, I still wear the same sized hat, and when I make my fill I am coming back to visit all the old boys. If you meet any of them, tell them I ain't got the big-head worth a cent. I am over here for dust. Will be glad to hear from any of them. Write me again. Your old-time friend.</p>
