      <p class="tei_p">"<a href="../item/wfc.person#charging.thunder">CHARGING THUNDER</a>."—This well-known member of the Wild West Show, who was remitted to the Sheriff on a charge of assaulting Mr <a href="../item/wfc.person#crager.g">Craiger</a>, an interpreter, with an Indian club, on Monday, came up from the County Buildings to Duke Street Jail in a van along with the gang of 20 other untried prisoners. In the prison he was doffed of his own "toggery" and furnished with a rig out of dark moleskin. He has, however, been allowed by the authorities to wear his ornaments. He relished the warm bath as a luxury not often enjoyed.</p>
