      <h3>OUR WEEKLY WHIRLIGIG.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">Hullo, here! How do you like the warm weather, eh? Summer's come upon us with a rush, hasn't it? and the time is not far distant now when the Eminent will pack his numerous traps, gather his family around him, and quit the hot dusty metropolis and endeavour to recuperate his shattered energies by sojourning for a few months by the sad sea waves. But you are impatient. I will detain you no longer. <em class="hi">On June the fourth all Eton's gay, For 'tis Commemoration day:—The Church contrives the rent to men—The Miners Strike is an an end:—Though he's resigned, we soon again Shall hear a lot of Mr. Blaine:—Ancient Fabric, as we see, Is anxious to remain M.P.:—Some fiery Cossacks here behold, They're at the Wild West Show, I'm told:—The Czar and Emp'ror meet at Kiel, And ask each other how they feel:—Of warmish days we've had a spell, But we can do with more as well.</em> That's all this week. Ta, ta!——THE SLOPERIAN SHOWMAN.</p>
