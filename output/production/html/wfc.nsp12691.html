      <h3>Buffalo Bill's Wild West Review.</h3>
      <div class="tei_p p">A sixpennyworth that will probably have a large sale both in London and the country is "Buffalo Bill's Wild West Review." It is being published this week by L. Plum, 102, Richmond-road, Earl's Court, on the satisfactory terms of 4s. 6d. per dozen of 13, carriage paid. The book is foolscap folio in size, covered with a highly-attractive coloured wrapper and made up of 20 pages of high tone paper.

saying a great deal in the artistic world. The literary matter has been compiled from various descriptions of the great show by William Langan, and it is a most interesting account. Apart from its value as a record of the Wild West Exhibition, this publication affords an excellent idea of North American Indian life, besides acting as a very suitable boy's book. The portrait we give of Buffalo Bill is an example of the artistic merit referred to. The trade can get a specimen copy for fourpence post free, by applying to Mr. Plum.</div>
