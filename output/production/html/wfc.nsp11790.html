         <p>ROME, March 5.—Buffalo Bill's cowboys conquered a second pair of wild horses furnished by the Duke Sermoneta to-day. The Romans were in a frenzy of excitement over the event, and the betting was very heavy.</p>

         <p>Enormous crowds went to the Prati di Castello, and outside speculators erected big stands on the surrounding hills. It is even said that the battle was watched with opera glasses from the Vatican. Prince Jérôme Bonaparte and the whole Roman aristocracy was present.</p>

         <h4>A TUG OF WAR.</h4>

         <p>The two powerful black stallions were driven into the arena by the Dukes cowboys from the Pontine Marshes, then the American cowboys appeared, and a terrific struggle followed. Buffalo Bill lassoed one horse, and the furious animal broke the rope. Lasso after lasso was snapped like thread. Meanwhile the Romans were shouting with exctement. Finally <span class="persName">

         <h4>ACCEPTS THE CHALLENGE.</h4>

         <p>The Duke of Sermoneta has taken up Colonel Cody's challenge, and will supply some Italian cowboys to ride the bucking bronchos on Friday. All the American cowboys are betting against the Italians, and "Buck" Taylor offers $500 on "Jubilee," which he backs against any Italian who may try to ride him.</p>
