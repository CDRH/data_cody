      <h3>COLONELS CODY'S REALISM.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">Mimic executions are all very well in their way, but their way is wrong, as Colonel Cody will discover very early if his demonstrations of Judge Lynch are either not modified or wiped out altogether from his Earl's Court entertainment. To morbid tastes there is a certain attractiveness in what is not only a sickening but a demoralising spectacle—in seeing an accurate illustration of the agonies in death of a lynched being. Despite this, it is to be hoped that the Colonel, who has so far, in his semi-civilised troupe of entertainers, never encroached to such an extent on the refinement and delicacy of his patrons, will withdraw from his performance at an early date this ghastly imitation of lynching.</p>
