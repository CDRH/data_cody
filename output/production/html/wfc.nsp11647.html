      <h3>ENTERTAINMENT IN THE THEATRE ROYAL</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">To-morrow evening, in the Theatre Royal in Moss Street, an entertainment will be given by about sixty of the artistes who took part in Buffalo Bill's Show in Glasgow. The performers will be the popular Cowboy Band, who will be assisted by the Alberger troupe of Tyrolean vocalists, and the Sioux Indians. Local patrons of the recent show in Glasgow will remember with pleasure the parts undertaken by the above, and are assured of several hours' genuine instruction and enjoyment by attendance to-morrow night.</p>
