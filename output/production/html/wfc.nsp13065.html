      <p class="tei_p">—Buffalo Bill does not intend to retire, as many people have been induced to suppose by the advertised sale of his peaceable buck-jumpers. On the contrary, the hero of Earl's Court intends to exte[nd] operations at Chicago next year, and among the novelties arranged for is a sample prairie fire. We should all liked to have seen this at the London entertainment, and no doubt Colonel Cody would have been pleased to supply the attraction; it was probably compassion for the surrounding neighbors, and the fear of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade turning up suddenly in order to extinguish the prairie, that induced him to hold over such tremendous realism for his fellow-countrymen.</p>
