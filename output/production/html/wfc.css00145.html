      <p>Note: Letter and envelope. Julia Cody Goodman (1843-1928) was WFC's elder sister (and eldest). BBWW performed in Manchester, England, April 13-May 2, 1903. McCullough Peaks are located about fifteen miles northeast of Cody, Wyoming, and south of the pioneer community of Corbett, Wyoming [see Bonner, p135]. DeMaris Hot Springs is located on the Shoshone River just west of Cody; Garland is a small community northeast of Cody and Ralston. Located between Corbett and Ralston was Eagles Nest stage stop. South Fork, Ishawooa, and Dry Fork are located near Cody. DeForest Richards was Governor of Wyoming until his death on April 28, 1903. Additional notes needed on Carey Act, Homestead Act, Shoshone Irrigation Co., State Land Board, and Burlington Quincy Railroad. "Mr. Ridgely" likely refers to H. S. Ridgely who was one of WFC's divorce lawyers in Cody.</p>
