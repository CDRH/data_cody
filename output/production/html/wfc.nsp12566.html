And what <em class="hi">is</em>she about now, with that man? They're actually having a duel with knives—on <em class="hi">horseback</em> too! not at <em class="hi">all</em> a nice thing for any young girl to do. There! she's pulled out a pistol and shot him—and galloped off as if nothing had happened! I have always heard that American girls were allowed a good <em class="hi">deal</em> of liberty—but I'd really no idea they went as far as this! I should be sorry indeed to see any girl of <em class="hi">mine (here she glances instructively at three dumpy and dough-faced Daughters)</em> acting in that forward and <em class="hi">most</em> unfeminine manner. <em class="hi">(Reassuringly.)</em> But I'm very sure there's no fear of <em class="hi">that,</em> is there, dears?</p>
