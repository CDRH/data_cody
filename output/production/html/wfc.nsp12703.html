      <p class="tei_p">A New Arm for Cavalry.—A number of gentlemen assembled recently in the arena of the "Wild West" at Earl's Court, placed at the disposal of Capt. W. Peel by Col. Cody, to witness a trial of a new system of furnishing cavalry with firearms. It consists in fastening on the girths a repeating rifle, in this case a Winchester with short stock, the barrel of which projects between the horse's fore-legs. The idea, which emanated from Capt. Peel, is to enable the horseman, when charging infantry, to demoralise his foes with a rapid fire. He discharges the weapon by means of a wire cord held in his bridle hand, leaving the other free for the use of sabre or lance. Of course precision of aim must be out of the question, direction is all that can be counted upon, and the experiment proved that at the trot or gallop the weapon is steadier than at the walk. Various defects—which could however be remedied—were pointed out by the different spectators, Col. Cody in particular suggesting that the main part of the weapon should be enclosed in a second sheath, so as to prevent it being interfered with when the horseman is engaged on land covered with brushwood.</p>
