         <p class="tei_p">I am asked by Mr. <a href="../item/wfc.person#burke.j">John M. Burke</a>, general manager of Buffalo Bill's Wild West, to state that the man Howard, who made a statement in connection the murder and suicide at Brompton, was never connected with the Show as a cowboy.</p>

         <h3>BUFFALO BILL.</h3>
         <p class="tei_p">This great <em class="hi">entrepreneur</em> and bold, brave man, to boot, has issued a manifesto to all whom it may concern, that he must bid a last long farewell to our shores in October. We most decidedly shall miss him. Some of my precisians object to the noise of his entertainment, and the look and habits of his merry men; but such people would abolish infancy because babies cry. We like movement, bustle, excitement and colour. The old borough is in danger of growing too demure, too dully respectable. Buffalo Bill dispels no small parry of our gloom, and his Indians, Cossacks, and Cowboys are much more interesting to look at than our staid City fathers. We wish General Cody prosperity during the remainder of his stay, and we can honestly recommend every one of our readers to visit his splendid show before it departs hence.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Some of our high and haughty folk want the Earl's Court Exhibition to be closed because it comes between "the wind and their nobility." We hope that it may remain open for many a day.</p>
