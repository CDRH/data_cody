      <h3>BUFFALO BILL'S WILD WEST.</h3>
      <span class="tei_opener">
         <span class="tei_salute">TO THE EDITOR OF THE DAILY POST.</span>
      </span>
      <p class="tei_p">SIR,—In your notice of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show of the 26th inst. you represent the performances as having taken place at Olympia, and lower down you follow by saying that "the audiences at Earl's Court are to be initiated into the way in which it is done." Olympia is, geographically, very near indeed to Earl's Court, but regarded as a Buffalo Bill exhibition it is a very long way off!—Yours, &amp;c., </p>
