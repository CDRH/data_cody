      <h3>ROMAN DOINGS.</h3>
      <h3>GRAND RECEPTION AT THE PRIMOLI PALACE—BUFFALO BILL, INDIAN CHIEFS AND ITALIAN BEAUTIES.</h3>
      <span class="tei_byline">[FROM OUR REGULAR CORRESPONDENT.]</span>
      <div class="">
         <p class="tei_p">ROME, March 10.—Count Primoli gave a grand reception last night in honor of his cousin, Prince Jérôme Napoleon, which was attended by the élite of Roman society and the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Quirinal and Vatican.</p>

         <h4>"BUFFALO BILL" AND HIS CHIEFS.</h4>
         <p class="tei_p">The event of the evening was the entrance of Colonel William F. Cody and five of his Indian chiefs, who were in full gala costume. They were naturally much dazzled by the beauty and brilliant toilettes of the ladies, who crowded around the red men and addressed many questions to them, which they answered as best they could in broken English.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Amongst the ladies present were the Countess Pasolini, Princess Ruspoli, Countess Francesetti, Marchesa Casteldelfino, Marchesa Berardi, Princess Odescalchi, Countess Pandolfi, Marchesa Serlupi, and the Countess Senni.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Colonel Cody speaks with enthusiam of the courtesy he has met with in Rome. He leaves Rome to-day for Florence.</p>

         <h4>ITALIAN COWBOYS AND BRONCHOS.</h4>
         <p class="tei_p">On Saturday, two Italian cowboys, belonging to Prince Ruspoli, came for the purpose of riding two of Buffalo Bill's bronchos. After struggling for half an hour—the time given by Colonel Cody was ten minutes—Jubilee was ridden, but the Italians found it impossible to even mount the second horse, and they had to give it up.</p>

         <h4>QUEEN MARGHERITA.</h4>
         <p class="tei_p">Queen Margherita is still in deep morning for the Duke d'Aosta, but takes daily drives into the Campagna and receives Court ladies and the wives of statesmen and politicians.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">A lady-in-waiting to the Queen tells me that recently Her Majesty received two letters from the United States of America. One of these epistles requested Her Majesty to send the writer specimens of all the Italian postage stamps, and enclosed a stamped envelope to send them in. The second letter asked Queen Margherita for one of her cast off jewels.</p>
