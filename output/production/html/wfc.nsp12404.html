      <p class="tei_p">Her Majesty witnessed on Saturday afternoon a performance given in the Home Park of Windsor Castle, opposite the East Terrace, by Colonel Cody's Wild West Troupe. For the purpose of the display an oval hippodrome was formed upon the lawn, surrounded by hurdles. The Royal pavilion was a tastefully-arranged crimson-draped tent, in which chairs had been placed for the <a href="../item/wfc.person#victoria.q">Queen</a> and the members of the Royal Family and her Majesty's guests, of whom there were present Princess Christian, Prince and Princess Henry of Battenberg and their children, the Princess of Leiningen, and Princess Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein. The ladies and gentlemen connected with the Court were also spectators, and her Majesty had further kindly permitted the Palace and park servants and their families to assemble on the parapet to the south of the pavilion. The programme included all the special feats of the American cowboys, the Red Indians, Mexicans, Cossacks, and Gauchos familiar to the visitors at Earl's-court, the entertainment closing with a general salute by all sections of the horsemen, which was graciously acknowledged by her Majesty.</p>
