      <p class="tei_p">Buffalo Bill is making an "absolute last farewell," and so highly popular has his entertainment become in England that souvenirs will be readily bought. The <em class="hi">Wild West Review,</em> therefore, was put on the market at a particularly opportune moment, and is accordingly a success. </p>
      <p class="tei_p">Mr. Henckel by the highly meritorious sketches he made for the book has made for himself a place in our midst as a capable artist, a fact evidenced by his receiving a commission from <em class="hi">Black and White</em> for a full page illustration of Indian life.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The <em class="hi">Review,</em> although not a paragon of excellence so far as style of production is concerned, is still an eminently saleable line; it it catchy, and has succeeded in exactly hitting the public taste.  The first edition is pretty well, if not quite, run out by this time, large numbers of copies having been soaked by the provinces.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The accompanying illustration is a representation of the picture of Buffalo Bill which adorns the cover of the work.</p>
