      <h3>MISS ANNIE OAKLEY.</h3>
      <p class="tei_note">Shooting</p>
      <p class="tei_note">London April 6th 87</p>
      <p class="tei_p">THIS <a href="../item/wfc.person#oakley.a">young lady</a> is one of the numerous shooting wonders which have been produced in America. She is twenty years of age, and has practised shooting from almost babyhood, until she has now attained to great skill with shot-gun, rifle and pistol. With the rifle she once made a score of 943 glass balls (36 behind Ruth's "record") out of 1,000. We believe that she is engaged to appear at the coming American Exhibition in May next.</p>
