      <h3>BUFFALO BILL IN ITALY.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">The Naples correspondent of The London Telegraph says of Buffalo Bill's show at that place: "It is a quite new one for the Neapolitans, few of whom have read Fenimore Cooper and know what to make of the strange-looking and painted redskins, and the general impression was that these brave warriors, with their long silky hair, paint, and feathers, and beardless faces, were women. But the riding and shooting were highly appreciated, and the seats of the arena are crowded daily. Col. Cody is thinking of taking his Indians up Mount Vesuvius some moonlight night and giving them a war dance round the crater. These Indians have never seen a volcano, though they have heard of such as places where the devil keeps up his fires."
