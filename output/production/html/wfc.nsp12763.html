      <p class="tei_p">Mrs. Keeley bears so familiar and popular a name in English drama that some details of her recent visit to the Wild West are full of interest. I need scarcely say that the venerable lady did not go further than Earl's Court, and did not venture into the veritable region of buffaloes and cowboys. Her delight and admiration of Buffalo Bill's display were unbounded. She was particularly struck with the immense size of the place, and with the vast concourse of spectators. It is easy to understand how great must have been the contrast presented by the huge expanse filled by enormous crowds and brilliant with electric light to the gay little Adelphi Theatre in the Strand, where the Keeleys won their laurels. Colonel Cody received the veteran actress with marked attention, and put her in the Royal box. He was rewarded by her warm commendation of the performance. "You are all born actors," she said, an observation which Buffalo Bill laughingly declared he did not know that he ought to regard as a compliment, seeing that none of them were actors at all.</p>
