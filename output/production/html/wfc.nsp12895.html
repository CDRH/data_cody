      <h3>"BUFFALO BILL'S" WILD WEST.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">Colonel "Buffalo Bill" Cody does not leave London with the pleasant feelings he had on his first visit. His reception has been enthusiastic by the populace in the free seats—that is, the seats free to persons who have paid for admission to the Horticultural Exhibition. But he is not the petted darling of society that he was when he was a novelty, and therefore, fashionable. To his placards announcing the closing days of the show are added the significant words, "Never to return." The show is now apparently to be broken up, and the entire stud of horses is advertised for sale in magnificent coloured poster. Colonel Cody's disgust will be deepened by a queer discussion that has been raised anent the coming sale. It concerns the <em class="hi">bona fides</em> of the celebrated buck-jumpers that were the attraction of the show. The question is being asked, Were they real buck-jumpers or only trained trick-horses? It is pointed out as a significant factor in settling this problem that in the advertisements of sale there is nothing about buck-jumpers, but a great deal about horses "warranted free from vice." I need hardly point out that Colonel Cody would not be likely to offer his buck-jumpers for sale, if only for the reason that no one would care to buy them. I suggest the proper thing would be to shoot them. Death would be preferable to a life with the floggings these poor animals get twice a day in the Wild West.</p>
