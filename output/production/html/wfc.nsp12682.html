      <h3>BUFFALO BILL'S DONKEYS.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">SIR,—When the Paris Hippodrome left London, a kind friend bought and cared for the unfortunate stag. Does the ultimate fate of Buffalo Bill's most diverting and evidently happy donkeys not stir the pity of some of your wealthy readers into providing a happy old age for these poor creatures when Colonel Cody and his Redskins return to the land whence they came? A donkey who has been happy is so utterly forlorn when adversity overtakes him. Who will pity these poor creatures?—I am, sir, yours, etc., HUMANITAS.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">[First of all it should be ascertained whether of not the showman wishes to sell his donkeys, seeing that he proposes to continue his itinerant vocation.—ED.]</p>
