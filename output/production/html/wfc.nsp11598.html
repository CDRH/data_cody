      <p class="tei_p">BUFFALO BILL'S VISIT TO GLASGOW.—At the Glasgow Dean of Guild Court yesterday, the proprietors of the "Buffalo Bill Wild West Show" were granted permission to alter the buildings in which the Glasgow East End Industrial Exhibition was held last year. There will be a huge arena constructed, capable of seating 4700 persons—in place of the old structure.</p>
