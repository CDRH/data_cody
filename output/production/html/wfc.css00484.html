   <div class="note">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in St. Louis, Missouri, May 18-23, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "St. Louis, Mo. / Tuesday, May 19. Weather very bad—rained hard all morning. There was a severe electric storm that lasted from 7 until 11 P. M.; it put the arena in a frightful condition. The storm did us no harm, only from a business standpoint. We wondered that anyone came. Nate Salsbury returned to Chicago to-day. Johnny Baker made quite a hit in his act, when he stood on his head in the mud.
