      <p class="tei_p">THE WILD WEST SHOW AT EARL'S COURT.—Mr. Charles Armstrong, of Chelsea, writes to us: The death of Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay, the well-known buck-jumper of the "Wild West Show," will clear up the much debated question as to whether Buffalo Bill's buck-jumpers are wild and naturally restive, or circus-trained performers imitating or apeing the natural and violent antics of the wild, untamed horse of the bush and the prairie. Last week when I paid an evening visit to the show, the little skewbald horse, Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay, got away from the cowboys, but was soon re-captured. Being an expert in horses and a judge at horse shows, I flattered myself that I could readily discern a trained circus horse from a naturally restive one, and I have no hesitation in saying that Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay, the black bucker Dynamite, and the violent bucker Midnight, that required three men to hold him, were all natural restive horses, which had adopted bucking as the best means of protest against the subjection of man.</p>
