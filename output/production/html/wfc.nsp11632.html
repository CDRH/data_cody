      <p>Mr. <span class="persName">
            <a href="/doc/salsbury.n">Nat Salisbury</a>
         </span>, Buffalo Bill's energetic partner, has had a run across to America to celebrate the New Year, and has got back once more to the "location," in Bellgrove. Colonel Cody informs me that it is his intention to follow his partner's example and pay a brief visit to the land of the free and the more or less brave. He will leave very shortly and return before the "Wild West" leaves Glasgow—an event which is by no means imminent owing to the phenomenal success of the show. It is quite probable that Mr. Guilford of the Grand Hotel may accompany Colonel Cody on his transatlantic trip.</p>
