Mr. C. E. Perkins, 
No. 710 Sears Bldg., Boston, Mass.

<span class="tei_salute">My dear Mr. Perkins:</span>
      </span>

      <p>I enclose an enthusiastic letter in regard to the Big Horn Basin from Col. W. F. Cody.</p>

      <p>Of course Buffalo Bill's interests in that locality compel enthusiasm, but I have no doubt from what I hear from other sources that there is chance for tremendous development in the Big Horn Basin.</p>

      <p>The Mormons of Utah and Idaho are increasing, by natural processes, very rapidly and there seems to be a shortage of water for irrigation purposes, which compels them to seek new localities.</p>

      <p>I thought it well to send this letter to you as it is an encouragement to proceed with what is underway.</p>
      <span class="tei_closer">
         <span class="tei_salute">Your truly,</span>
         <span class="tei_signed">(Sgd.) Charles F. Manderson.</span>
