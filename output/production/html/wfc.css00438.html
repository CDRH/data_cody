         <a name="n01.note"> </a>Note 1: Although Cody did not include the year in the dateline of this letter, it was almost certainly written in 1895.  Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Hartford, Connecticut, on June 3, 1895. <a href="#n01.ref"> [back] </a>

Paxton</a>, a successful businessman in Omaha, Nebraska, to invest in their Big Horn Basin irrigation venture, which would become the <a href="../item/wfc.encyc#company.s">Shoshone Irrigation Company</a>.

         <a name="n05.note"> </a>Note 5: Cody refers to <a href="../item/wfc.person#hymer.w">William E. Hymer</a>, an early partner in his Big Horn Basin irrigation project who was later dropped from the venture by the other partners.  According to historian Robert Bonner, Hymer's participation was a key reason why William A. Paxton chose not to invest in the project. <a href="#n05.ref"> [back] </a>

         <a name="n06.note"> </a>Note 6: "Cunningham" is likely <a href="../item/wfc.person#cunningham.d">Dennis Cunningham</a> (b. 1843), who then owned considerable property in Omaha, Nebraska, and was a partner in an Omaha-based contracting firm.  "Ryan" is likely Jerry Ryan, who had been sent by George Beck to assess irrigation possibilities in the Big Horn Basin in 1893.  A man named Jerry Ryan was one of Cunningham's partners in his Omaha contracting business, but it is not clear whether Cunningham's associate was the same person who reconnoitered the Big Horn Basin for Beck.  Cunningham and Ryan were apparently stockholders in the Shoshone Land and Irrigation Company, the predecessor of the Shoshone Irrigation Company, the concern that actually built the <a href="../item/wfc.encyc#canal.c">Cody Canal</a>.  Neither man appears to have contributed much capital to the project, and neither remained in the inner circle of investors when the Shoshone Irrigation Company replaced the previous company. <a href="#n06.ref"> [back] </a>
