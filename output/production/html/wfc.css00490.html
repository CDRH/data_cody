   <div class="note">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Springfield, Ohio, on July 7, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "Springfield, Ohio. / Tuesday, July 7. Arrived in town at 5 A. M. Two-mile haul to lot. If ever Anderson prayed for still weather he did to-day. We could not get a stake down over twelve inches anywhere and the least wind would have blown us down, but with our usual good luck we came out all right. Refreigo Carrello, a Mexican, was thrown in the grand entree to-day; his left shoulder was badly hurt and sprained and he received a lot of small bruises and was badly used up. Master-Mechanic Dan Taylor left to-day for Columbus, Ohio, to get the grounds ready for our next Monday's engagement. / Business at both performances good. / Lot, Columbus and Isabell streets. / Arena, 182 x 368."</div>
