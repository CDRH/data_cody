      <h3>BUFFALO BILL'S LATEST.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">We take the following from <em class="hi">Science Siftings:</em>—</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In an early number we described a multiple railway system, which is to be a leading feature of the Chicago Exhibition. We now learn that a powerful syndicate has been formed by Colonel Cody and Colonel <a href="../item/wfc.person#salsbury.n">Nate Salsbury</a> and some leading English capitalists to promote the enterprise in Great Britain. A combination of Paris bankers has also approved the invention, and proposes to introduce the same in France. This novel American invention promises to revolutionize modern methods of locomotion.</p>
