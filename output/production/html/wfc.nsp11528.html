         <span class="bold">"THE WILD WEST" IN LEEDS.—</span>Readers may be glad to be reminded that the two performances to-day at "Buffalo Bill's" Wild West encampment bring the visit of this truly remarkable exhibition of frontier life and adventure to an end. The audiences during the week have been large and most enthusiastic, and during their stay here the leading members of the combination have made many and warm friends, from Gen. Cody and <a href="../item/wfc.person#salsbury.n">Mr Salsbury</a>, <a href="../item/wfc.person#burke.j">Major Burke</a>, Mr Hart, <a href="../item/wfc.person#crager.g">Mr Crager</a>, and others downwards. All the staff, in fact, have shown the liveliest concern for the comfort and enjoyment of the public. At the close of the last performance to-night the company start for Liverpool.</p>
