      <h3>BURIAL OF AN INDIAN CHIEF IN LONDON.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">Long Wolf, a celebrated Ogallalla Sioux warrior recently attached to Buffalo Bill's company, died in St. George's Hospital on Saturday, after a short illness, due partly to old age and partly to trouble caused by numerous old wounds received in battle. He was buried yesterday in West Brompton Cemetery with much picturesque ceremony. Long Wolf had an interesting history. He was with the Pawnees in the attack upon and capture of Fort Peril, Kearney, the only fortified post ever captured by Indians. For many years afterwards he was an advocate of peace and he was the first man to surrender his rifle to General <a href="../item/wfc.person#miles.n">Miles</a> in the last war at Pine Ridge.</p>
