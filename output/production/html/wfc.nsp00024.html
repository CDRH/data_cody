      <h3>Big Chief Sees Buffalo Bill.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">His eyes almost blinded by old age and scarcely able to walk, old Tom Whirlwind Horse, father of one of the Indians now performing with the Wild West Show, witnessed the performance last night at Madison Square Garden. He had come all the way from the Pine Ridge Agency just because he had heard the call of Col. Cody's exhibition and wished to see the representation of the Battle of Summit Springs, in which he was with the hostile braves that fought Buffalo Bill.</p>
