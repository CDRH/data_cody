      <p>Wherever the party was entertained there were always hearty congratulations forthcoming upon the rapid progress now being made, and upon the number of applications for space now being received. Like all other representative Englishmen, Henry Irving and his friend, J. C. Parkinson,<a href="#n02" class="internal_link">2</a> take a deep interest in the American Exhibition.</p>

      <p>On Friday evening, August 27, all the above named gentlemen paid a visit to the "Wild West," which Buffalo Bill and his party intend to exhibit in London next summer as a compliment to the American Exhibition.</p>
