         <span class="tei_salute">Dear John.</span>
      </span>

      <p>The round up with the Chicago heat nearly wore me out. But its nice &amp; cool this week. The Shan-Kive. as they called it was badly named and worse managed, else it would have be a great financial success. How ever the night business was good. too hot for matinees every body went to the lake that could like they did in 1913 when we were there</p>

      <p>All <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="prizes​">prises</a> were paid in full. and all contestants happy. J Ogden Armour put up the <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="prizes​">prises</a>.</p>

      <p>Say. I got two letters from Officers on the Border. They discourage what you proposed. Saying no telling how long the Guards will stay there. Besides they have their own caturs—</p>

         <span class="tei_salute">Regards to all—</span>
