      <p class="tei_p">At a quarter to three o'clock yesterday afternoon considerable alarm was caused at Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show by a fire breaking out in a large timber building, used as a store, through the explosion of a mineral oil lamp. A private hydrant was set to work, and the flames were prevented from spreading to other parts of the show, but the structure just mentioned was practically destroyed.</p>
