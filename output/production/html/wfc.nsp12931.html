      <h3>THE "WILD WEST" AT WINDSOR.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">On Saturday "Buffalo Bill" and his Wild West Company had the honour of appearing before the <a href="../item/wfc.person#victoria.q">Queen</a> in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The weather was all that could be desired, and the ground presented a very brilliant appearance when the Royal party arrived on the scene. Prince and Princess of Battenberg and the Princess Christian were among those present to witness the performance. The programme gone through was of an attractive description, commencing with a race between the representatives of each of the different nationalities—the American Cowboys, the Red Indians, the Mexicans, the Cossacks, and the Gauchos. Then followed a series of scenes of Indian camp life, which the red men went through with much spirit, after which the Gauchos, whose picturesque costume and intrepid feats greatly interested the Royal party, gave their performance. Next came "the race for life, " showing Colonel Cody and a band of Cowboys being pursued by hostile Indians, whom they ultimately defeated. The Cossacks, under Prince Ivan Makharadze, also gave exhibitions of horsemanship and dancing. The buckjumpers and Cowboys also went though their diverting performances, and Colonel Cody displayed his wonderful dexterity as a marksman, the entertainment being brought to a close by a general salute by all sections of horsemen, which was graciously acknowledged by the Queen. The greatest success attended every detail of the representation, and the Queen personally congratulated Colonel Cody. The party returned to Earl's court by special train immediately after the conclusion of the performance.</p>
