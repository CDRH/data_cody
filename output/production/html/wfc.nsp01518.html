      <h3>Life at the Wild West Show.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">The sun has been shining brightly during the past few days, and its effect on the people has been seen by the increased crowds at Ambrose Park, where Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World are exhibiting for the Summer season. While the entertainments have been given twice every day since the opening on May 12, the continued bad weather had of course an effect on the attendance, although, when the weather is considered, their audiences have been wonderfully good. Everything is life and excitement in this great exhibition. Not a number drags, and it is hard to determine which is the most interesting. Every style of horsemanship on the face of the globe almost is represented in this aggregation of rough riders. Perhaps one of the best lot of riders are the Russian Cossacks, who seem to take delight in standing on their heads on their horses' shoulders, sitting on their horses' necks and riding backward, standing upright in the saddle and going like lightning, and other difficult feats. There is plenty to amuse and educate in the Wild West, and New-Yorkers are fortunate to have such an entertainment for the dull Summer season.</p>
