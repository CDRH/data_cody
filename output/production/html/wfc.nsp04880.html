      <h3>Buffalo Bill as a Brave.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">Hon. William F. Cody is meeting the fate of all great men in being unappreciated in his own bailiwick. Here is Father Craft, for instance, remarking: "Cody is hovering around the settlements, but so far has not smelled any powder. He will most probably try to get Indians for his show through the military officials here." And our other old friend, Colonel "Pat" Donan, is made to declare in a recent dispatch: "In all this Indian tragedy there was but one ludicrous feature. It was enough to make a coyote laugh. Bill Cody's glorious exploits have been chiefly performed by the pens and pencils of newspaper liars instead of his own dripping tomahawk and scalping knife. From first to last he has been a picturesque and well-advertised fraud."</p>
