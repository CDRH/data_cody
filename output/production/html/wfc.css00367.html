      <p class="tei_p">The citizens of Cody, Wyo., are <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title=" very much​">verymuch</a>  alarmed owing to your surveyors surveying a line on the north side of the Shoshone river opposite the town of Cody.  This survey runs from Corbett to the hot springs, three miles above Cody.  Can I assure residents of Cody that when you do build into that country that you will build to Cody?  You know I have spent six years of time and lots of money to open up that unknown country.</p>
