      <p class="tei_p">Mrs. "Buffalo Bill" is an amiable domestic woman, very popular in the neighbourhood of North Platte, where she lives. Her home, Scout's Rest, is a long, low building, four miles from the town, large and roomy, quite like a hotel, and it is surrounded by 3,000 acres of prairie land, magnificent stables and fine pasture lands, where are kept many thousands of fine-blooded horses and cattle.</p>
