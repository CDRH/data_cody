      <h3>A NOVELTY AT THE WILD WEST.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">At Buffalo Bill's "Wild West" will be introduced to-day some novel features in the already rather extensive programme. These will consist of two highly interesting and diverting historical pictures, representative of the administration of Western justice, in a case of horse-stealing, with Judge Lynch as judge, jury, and executioner. There will also be scenes illustrative of the capture by Indians of a pioneer train, in which the playful antics of the untutored savage while engaged in torturing his victim will be shown in connection with the "Running of the Gauntlet," "Burning at the Stake," &amp;c. "The World's Rough Riders," represented by the various bands of Cossacks, Gauchos, cowboys, and others, will from next Monday be more prominently put forward than before in Colonel Cody's highly entertaining programme. </p>
