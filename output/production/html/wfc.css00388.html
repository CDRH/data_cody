         <a name="n01.note"> </a>Note 1: Although Cody did not include the year in his dateline, this letter was most likely written in 1913. References in this letter to his motion picture <em class="hi">The Indian Wars</em> as a work in progress suggest 1913, since the film was a sufficiently finished product to exhibit in Washington by February 1914. Cody has overwritten the numeral indicating the day—it could read as either 13 or 14.  Later in the letter, Cody indicates that "tomorrow" would be a Sunday. December 14, 1913, was a Sunday; which suggests that the letter was written on December 13. <a href="#n01.ref"> [back] </a>

         <a name="n02.note"> </a>Note 2: "Fred Hutchison" is probably Frederick Bailey Hutchinson (c.1872-1944), nephew of the famous showman James A. Bailey (1847-1906). Hutchinson served as manager for Buffalo Bill's Wild West during its final European tour, 1902-1906. "Carlo" is probably Carlo (or Carlos) Miles, who had been listed as a "Mexican performer" in 1910-11 route books for Buffalo Bill's Wild West combined with Pawnee Bill's Great Far East. Contemporary newspaper accounts sometimes referred to Miles as an "Indian," perhaps due to his skin tone. Miles (or Myles) is believed to have appeared in Cody's film <em class="hi">The Indian Wars</em>. <a href="#n02.ref"> [back] </a>
