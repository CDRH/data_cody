      <p class="tei_p">It would be a hard task to determine upon what grounds the delegates of the London Working Men's Association thought it necessary that Colonel W. F. Cody should be presented with an illuminated address, though at the same time it must be remembered that there are few men who can hope to escape such a distinction any more than Frenchmen can avoid receiving the Cross of the Legion of Honour. In presenting the address, "Buffalo Bill" was congratulated on the splendour of his show, and and its value from an educational standpoint. This, no doubt, is all very well in its way, but as Colonel Cody could not hope to make money by exhibiting a poor show, he had as a matter of fact to make it a good one. He has made a "pile" out of it, and we see no reason why he should be looked upon as a philanthropist any more that anyone else who earns his livelihood from the patronage of the British public. Of course, it would have been too much to expect that he could have let the opportunity go by without bringing in the usual American boast as to the United States being the best country in the world, and "where sunshine and prosperity met men in every walk of life." Such a statement would imply that neither sunshine nor prosperity met men in every walk of life in this country.</p>
