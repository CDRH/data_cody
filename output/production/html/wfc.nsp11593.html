      <p class="tei_p">OMAHA, January 7.—A telegram from <a href="../item/wfc.person#miles.n">General Miles</a> has been received here stating that five of the principal Indian bands came into Pine Ridge agency yesterday. The General expresses the hope that all the Redskins will soon surrender, and declares that the settlers occupying land close to the line of railway can stay on their farms.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">PINE RIDGE, January 7.—The people along the Elk Horn and Missouri Valley Railroad in Nebraska believe they will be in great peril should the expected battle with the Indians result adversely to the United States. One thousand men of the Nebraska Militia are in the field, and reinforcements have been ordered.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Colonel Cody (Buffalo Bill) thinks the Indians are in a state of frenzy, courting death. Should the braves overcome the troops at Pine Ridge they will overrun the country, and even if defeated they will do immense damage.</p>
