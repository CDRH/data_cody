      <p class="tei_p">I am in receipt today of a letter dated February 1, from Mr. W. F. Cody, in which he states that he was that day writing you with reference to a set of motion picture films of pictures taken on the Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota, and requesting that you send a copylete [sic] set to this Department, which request it seems your Company overlooked at the time the pictures were taken in 1913.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">We shall be very glad to receive these films at as early a date as possible and have to request that you send them addressed to the Chief Clerk, Department of the Interior, direct.</p>
      <span class="tei_closer">
         <span class="tei_salute">Very truly yours,</span>
