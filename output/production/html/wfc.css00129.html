      <p>Note: Letter and envelope. Julia Cody Goodman (1843-1928) was WFC's elder sister (and eldest). "Finley" refers to Julia's son Finley Goodman (1880-1951). Roy Myers (1881-1919) was son of WFC's sister Eliza Alice Cody Myers (1848-1902). Johnny Baker (1869-1931) was WFC's foster son. "Fred Remington" was Frederic Remington (1861-1909), the artist and friend of WFC's. Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Trenton, New Jersey, May 22, 1902, which confirms the year.</p>
