      <p class="tei_p">Colonel Cody has left this country with great regret; there is much sentiment in his nature, as there is also gratefulness for the friendly feeling evinced towards him throughout this country. He can count a large number of first-rate manly fellows among his intimate circle; to some of them, being bachelors, he has given a special invitation to go our and have a high time of hunting for big game in Colorado. No doubt the event will come off with <em class="hi">eclat,</em> and the plans have already been well considered and prepared from start to return. One of his planned amusements is for his cowboys, Mexicans and Indians only, who are to go on a long distance ride for a prize; the present notion is to start form New York and end at Chicago, towards which all the world seems inclined to centre. </p>
