      <h3>JUDGE LYNCH IN LONDON.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">The Wild West Exhibition at Earl's Court on Monday afternoon had several fresh illustrations introduced. Like other features these novel items are replete with dramatic animation, holding attention and stimulating fancy from start to finish. Foremost in the new pictures of life in the least civilized American States is one entitled "The Deserter." On the lookout for anything in the shape of loot, this loafing son of Mars encounters a tethered horse near his master, glad to find a "lodging on the cold ground." Making off with his plunder, its owner awakens to fortunately meet a squad of prairie troopers, and who informs them of the robbery. Off they ride in pursuit of the marauder, afterwards captured, and hanged on a rude gibbet at the fiat of the historic Judge Lynch. The incidents are cleverly represented in pantomime. It is also excitingly utilized in another Wild West depiction. Here the spectators witness a pioneer train of emigrants making a pilgrimage to the land of the setting sun. While preparing supper they are surprised by a whooping and truculent band of savages. An old scout is seized and maltreated, and an attempt made to abduct a beautiful sun-browned daughter of the plains. Imminent as may seem her perils, a human providence is at hand in the athletic chivalry of Buffalo Bill and a train of devoted cowboys, who scatter vengeance and protect hapless woman. To these cleverly-designed and vigorously worked out tableaux are added a race between a Cossack, cowboy, Gaucho, Indian, and Mexican, on Spanish-Mexican, Broncho, Russian, and Indian ponies, and other episodes. The fresh features prove highly attractive.</p>
