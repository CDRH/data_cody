      <p class="tei_p">COWBOYS AT ST. PAUL'S.—Curiously enough no notice has been taken in the press of the visit of part of Buffalo Bill's troupe to St. Paul's Cathedral on Sunday morning last. Writes a correspondent: "They sat two seats in front of me, and I am afraid more attention was paid to them than to the service. It was a strange meeting of red men from the far West (Sioux Indians) and Russians from Eastern Europe (the recently-arrived Cossacks) sitting together and apparently devoutly attending to a service which they could not possibly have understood. The Indians, I believe, were greatly impressed by the service (though I am afraid a few of them looked bored before the thing was over), and particularly charmed by the music of the big organ. To this moment they cannot be made to understand where the sound came from, and how it was produced. As the party entered and left in a body were shown to three consecutive rows of seats, and were under police escort, the visit must have been arranged."</p>
