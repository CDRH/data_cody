      <h3>FALSE IMPRESSION GIVEN ITALIANS OF AMERICAN CITIES</h3>
      <h3>Buffalo Bill's 'Wild and Wooly West' and Movies Are the Real Cause</h3>
      <h3>WOMAN INTERVIEWED</h3>
      <h3>Madame Montre Says it Must be Very Difficult to Live in the States</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">Rome, Dec 5. — (By Mail.) — Buffalo Bill's Wild West has "advertised" America throughout Europe. His circus, playing frequently to European spectators, has left a trail of false impressions behind it. The American "movies" shown here only emphasize them.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The case of Madame Montre interviewed today in a Roman boarding house is by no means uncommon. She is a well known writer and literary woman.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">"O you are an American!" she began. "I am so glad to meet you. For I am making a scientific study of America.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">"I was recently presented to some people from a State called Indiana. Really they didn't look so much like Indians. Of course, their manners were a little off.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">"It must be very difficult for one to live in the States. The constant clash of the American and the Indian civilizations is undoubtedly a nerve-racking annoyance.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">"Of course, the poor Indians really did give a civilization to the world. They were a simple and natural people, having a real art and a real literature.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">"The Indian at least has blood and not machine oil in his veins. Naturally, there are some savages, the good being always mixed with the bad."</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The Americans are frequently called "the Germans of the New World." Now New York City is regarded as the beginning and end of the United States. It is alleged a riot of sky-scraping buildings, cocktail-loving women, spoiled wives and fresh children.</p>
