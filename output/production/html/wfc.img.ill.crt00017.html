            Headline reads: Getting it Hot. 
Six inset captions:
There was once a Noble Savage - who was invited to a Swell Dinner.
He went literally in his War Paint.
When he had eaten? quite as much as was good for him ...
He thought he would try a little Custard.
He had mistaken the sound of the Word. It was Mustard!!!!
He has now returned to the simple habits of his Fathers.
