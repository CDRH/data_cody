      <p class="tei_p">Pinkerton, the head of the American bloodletting detective organisation, has been in London for some time, and returned to America yesterday. He was seen at Buffalo Bill's the other night with a couple of Scotland Yard detectives, but if he came to England for any other purpose than that of pleasure the object of his visit has not been disclosed. </p>
