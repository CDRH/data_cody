      <p class="tei_p">The Delaware Indians, about 80 in number, returned from a buffalo hunt last Saturday. They were with Col. Sumner in a battle with the Cheyennes, on the Smoky Hill, a short time since. One young Delaware brought in the scalp and armor which he took in the fight, from a chief. This chief had killed two dragoons with his bow and arrow, and was turning to flee when intercepted by the Delaware, who shot him with a revolver, and took his scalp and armor. The scalp may be seen hanging on a pole, out at Sarcoxie's, the Delaware Chief.</p>
