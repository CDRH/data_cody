      <h3>CHASING A WILD HORSE IN LONDON.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">CONSIDERABLE excitement was caused in the West-end on Wednesday night between nine and ten o'clock by a runaway horse galloping furiously down Piccadilly with two mounted men in hot pursuit. The animal had escaped from the Wild West Exhibition at Earl's Court. Antonio Prevost and another cowboy were immediately despatched in chase of the runaway, but did not overtake it for some time. Meanwhile the horse made its way eastward until it reached the Strand, continuing down Weilington-street to Waterloo Bridge. Numerous attempts were made to stop the animal, but they had only the effect of increasing its speed, and unfortunately John Barnet, of 12, Kemble-street, Drury-lane, was knocked down and received severe injuries. He was at once conveyed to Charing-cross Hospital, but died on the way. The horse was ultimately secured.</p>
