The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary for Sunday, September 20th: "Sioux Falls, S. D. / Sunday, September 20. Arrived in town at 5.30 A. M. Three-mile haul to lot and all across country roads. We were never so far from town or car service as we will be here. The street-car system consists of three miles of mule railroad with one car, consequently the trips average one an hour, and it does not run within one mile of the Fair Grounds, where we are located. Manager J. T. McCaddon, Fred Hutchinson, Annie Oakley, Frank Butler and William Sweeney went hunting to-day and came back with one prairie chicken, one jack rabbit and a duck. Big-top was not put up today. / Weather clear and cool and very windy. We found one-half inch ice this morning." <a href="#n01.ref"> [back] </a>

         <a name="n02.note"> </a>Note 2: "Bear Creek coal fields" are located at Bearcreek, Montana, about eight miles southeast of Red Lodge, Montana. In the Bearcreek district small mining operations started in the 1890's. Wagons pulled by horse and mule were used to haul coal to the railroad at Red Lodge. In 1897 the Montana Coal &amp; Iron Company was formed. By 1907 four major mines were operating; as the mines started producing, the Montana, Wyoming &amp; Southern Railroad laid tracks east of Bearcreek and eventually laid a line to these mines. <a href="#n02.ref"> [back] </a>
