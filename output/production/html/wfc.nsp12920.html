      <h3>Killed by a "Wild West" Horse.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">Yesterday afternoon, Mr. John Troutbeck held an inquiry at Charing Cross Hospital respecting the death of Henry Varnet M'Toldridge, aged thirty-six, a coal porter, late of 12, Kemble-street, Drury-lane, who was killed by a horse intended for Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. Police-constable George Grant deposed that on Thursday night he was proceeding towards the Strand when he saw a horse galloping over Waterloo Bridge towards Waterloo-road. He attempted to stop it, when it turned back towards the Strand. When he got about the middle of the bridge he saw the horse returning. A man was standing on the kerb with a carpet on his back, and as witness again attempted to stop the horse it lashed out with its legs, and the deceased received the full force of the blow in the left of his abdomen. He staggered and fell. Evidence was called showing that the man died soon afterwards. Antonie Prevost, a cowboy in the employ of colonel Cody, stated the the horse broke away from a herd he was bringing from Islington. It was a South American horse, and was quite wild. The jury returned a verdict of "Accidental death," and added that wild horses should be led through the streets either early morning or late at night.</p>
