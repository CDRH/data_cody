      <p class="tei_p">Colonel Buffalo Bill Cody does not leave London with the pleasant feeling he had on his first visit. His reception has been enthusiastic by the populace in the free seats—that is, the seats free to persons who have paid for admission to the Horticultural Exhibition, but he is not the petted darling of society that he was when he was a novelty, and therefore fashionable. On his placard announcing the closing days of the show are added the significant words, "Never to return." The show is now apparently to be broken up, and the entire stud of horses is advertised for sale in magnificent coloured posters. But Colonel Cody's disgust will be deepened by a queer discussion that has been raised anent the coming sale. It concerns the <em class="hi">bona-fide</em> of the celebrated buck-jumpers that were the attraction of the show. The question is being asked—Were they real buck-jumpers or only trained trick-horses?</p>
