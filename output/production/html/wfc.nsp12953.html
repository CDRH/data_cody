      <h3>BASEBALL. </h3>
      <h3>The Cowboys Victorious Over Music Hall Men in Buffalo Bill's Arena.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">The Americans are a hardy race. It was proved at Buffalo Bill's "Wild West" this morning, when a team of cowboys opposed a team of American music-hall performers now fulfilling engagements in London, at the game of baseball. It needs a hardy man to engage in outdoor amusement in the depth of the English summer. It was shiveringly cold at Earl's-court, and Major <a href="../item/wfc.person#burke.j">Burke</a> had a big log fire cheerfully blazing in the old log hut, but the cowboys and American music-hall performers left their firesides, and took off their warm outer garments <br/>

TO PLAY BALL IN THE MUD<br/>

of the arena. Perhaps they could not have done it if there had not been a specially encouraging audience. American music-hall performers seem to have exceedingly good taste in the matter of marriage. Miss Katie Seymour, the charming Gaiety dancer, graced the proceedings. She is the wife of Mr. Athol, one of the music hall representatives. There were also Miss Bessie Bonehill (who is Mrs. Seeley), Mrs. R. G. Knowles, Miss Katie Lawrence, and a number of other ladies whose smiles ought to have spurred the music-hall team on to doing great deeds. Somehow or other their presence seemed to spur the wrong side. The cowboys had the game all their own way and won by 13 runs to five. Perhaps the cowboys were more used to the mud. The music hall team consisted of Messrs. R. Kelly, Wal Pink, J. Ashby, J. Marco, F. Huller, R. G. Knowles, T. Ardell, H. Athol, and G. Dare.</p>
