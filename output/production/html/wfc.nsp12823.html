      <h3>Buffalo Bill will Retire.</h3>
      <p class="tei_p">BUFFALO BILL has decided to quit showing and retire from the arena of the histrionic Wild West into what is left of the real thing. He has ten thousand acres in Nebraska, but civilisation is fast catching him up, so he has provided a nice little retreat, to which he can fly when he wishes to commune with Nature, a bit further out. This takes the shape of ninety-five thousand acres of Rocky Mountain territory, which, according to his description of it, must be a perfect hunter's paradise. He has been twenty years in the show business, and has made pots of money, so he is going to wind up next year at the World's Fair with a most tremendous flare-up, and then quit. He is a wise man to do so in the prime of life, while he has yet plenty of years of solid healthy enjoyment before him. </p>
