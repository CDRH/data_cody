CHIEFS IN COUNCIL.
From Our Own Special Earl's Court Interpreter.
  THE Distinguished Statesman and party had now arrive at the encampment, and it was explained to the illustrious Indian hero that the Great White Chief" was waiting to receive him without. In another instant "Yellow Slippers," ferocious in his war-paint and feathers, had sprung to the door of his tent with a wild war-whoop, and, brandishing his gleaming tomahawk, signified, in the stinging accents of the Sioux dialect, his readiness to meet all comers. There was some commotion among those assembled outside, but it quickly subsided on the Trapper announcing, at the Distinguished Statesman's request, that the "'Great White Father' had only come to have a little friendly talk over the peace pipe." Upon hearing this, the Indian, eyeing his supposed rival disdainfully, drew his blanket moodily around him, and waited for the conversation to commence.
  "I had better put a poser to him, to open with," observed the Distinguished Statesman, thoughtfully. "Ask him what, in his opinion, will be the probable effects of the forthcoming Show on the financial prospects of the General Omnibus Company, and the Metropolitan District Railway respectively, and how he thinks the Shareholders of either undertaking will view the progress of the projected enterprise."
  On this being translated to the "Yellow Slippers," he only glared fiercely for a few minutes in the direction of the "Great White Father," and then shook his head.
  "He does not understand," explained the Trapper.
  "Dear me, that's awkward," rejoined the Distinguished Statesman, "for, wishing to impress him, I had arranged several complicated questions for his solution. Ha! but I have them hinted at here in the notes for my luncheon speech Suppose you just read him this, I fancy it mayn't be very clear, for I haven't quite made up my own mind what it all means, and so, no doubt, it will probably puzzle him."
  He handed a well-penciled sheet of paper to the Trapper as he spoke. The latter proceeded forthwith to translate its contents to "Yellow Slippers," who, however, repeatedly shook his head at the various points, and gradually assumed an attitude of threatening defiance. Finally, on its conclusion, he instantly sprang to his feet, and again giving a wild war-whoop, expressed his desire to have done with palaver, and meet the "Great White Father" in combat in the arena, either with tomahawk or lasso, and there discuss with him, in a language he could understand, matters rather more within his ordinary comprehension.
  Affairs assuming, therefore, a rather threatening aspect, and "Yellow Slippers" being understood still to express a wish that instead of meeting the "Great White Father," surrounded by pale faces, at West Kensington, he could only come across him alone on the deserted plains of the real Wild West, the Distinguished Statesman and party hastily withdrew, and retired to another part of the extensive grounds under the guidance of the courteous officials who accompanied them.
