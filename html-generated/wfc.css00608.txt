  <span class="salute">Dear Sir:-</span>




      <p>We have received both of your letters relative to the Indian War pictures filmed on the Indian Reservation at Pine Ridge, S. D. in 1913.</p>
      <p>We furnished a set of these films to Col. W. F. Cody who, I believe, deposited them with the Department of War, but Mr. Spoor<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> claims to know nothing about any further promise made. He has not been advised relative to any offers by any parties concerned.</p>
      <p>Would suggest you take this matter up with the party who informed you (Col. W. F. Cody) relative to the depositing of films with the Department of Interior. If any such promise has been made it must have been made to the Honorable Mr. Lane<a href="../doc/n03" class="internal_link">3</a> personally, and would suggest that he take it up personally with the party who made the promise.</p>

      <span class="closer">
