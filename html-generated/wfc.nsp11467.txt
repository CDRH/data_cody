      <h3>BUFFALO BILL BOOMING</h3>
      <h3>A DUOLOGUE OF THE DAY.</h3>
      <div class="milestone line"> </div>
      <p>A CIT. I notice that you've taken to wearing the Cowboy Collars. Find 'em comfortable?</p>

      <p>ANOTHER CIT. Fairly so. Speaking of comfort, aren't those Mocassin Boots of yours dreadfully troublesome in wet weather?</p>

      <p>A CIT. Of course they are, but I was bound, for harmony's sake, to have a pair, as I'd started a Sioux Suit of blanket cloth. Like it?</p>

      <p>ANOTHER CIT. Awfully. In fact, now I’ve seen you in it, I shall never rest till I’ve had a Wampum Waistcoat built.</p>

      <p>A CIT. They’re very elegant. By the way, Mrs. Jones tells me that she recently met you in Oxford-street.</p>

      <p>ANOTHER CIT. Yes, your wife was wheeling a Papoose Perambulator, and it nearly went over my toes.</p>

      <p>A CIT. She’d ben to Peter Robinson's to buy a Squaw Costume for afternoon wear. You’ll admire her in it, when you see her again.</p>

      <p>ANOTHER CIT. I’ve no doubt I shall. <em class="hi">My</em> wife's meditating an investment in a gown of the kind; but in the meantime she's satisfied her fashionable longings by mounting a Log-hut Hat.</p>

      <p>A CIT. Ha! ha! These women must always be in the swim. Mrs. Brown'll be wanting you to take her to see <em class="hi">The Deadwood Coach</em>—the successful new piece at the Royal Arena Theatre—before very long, you see if she won't.</p>

      <p>ANOTHER CIT. Why, ever since she heard that they were turning money away nightly, she's been wild to go; and, to tell you the truth, I was trotting off to the booking-office to buy tickets when you and I stumbled across each other.</p>

      <p>A CIT. Were you now? Well, I myself was making for Mudie's, to try if I could get that popular novel, "Buffalo Bill's Bride; or, the Pearl of the Pampas." Mrs. J. is just frantic to read it.</p>

      <p>
         <em class="hi">[Exeunt severally upon their errands.</em>
