         <em class="hi">MISS ANNIE OAKLEY'S GUNS.</em>
      </h3>

      <p>SIR,—In answer to "L. A. C.," if long barrels are not considered a disadvantage, I should still recommend a 32-in. 20-bore in preference to 24 inches. I can make short barrels that will do good execution; but the majority of my customers find it easier to get on with the long barrels, to which they have been accustomed all their lives. If "L. A. C." will tell me exactly what he wants, I will undertake to make him a gun that will meet his views. <span class="persName">Miss Annie Oakley</span>'s guns are built on the Anson-Deeley patent, hammerless, without extension rib, 12-bore, 28-inch steel barrels, both choke, 6 ¼ lbs. weight, bored to shoot 42 grains "Schultze" and 1 oz. No. 6 shot, average—right 208, left 212, in 30-in. circle at 40 yards. Miss Oakley speaks in the highest terms of the guns. I can make them a little lighter, if necessary, without running any risk. —I am, &amp;c.,</p>
