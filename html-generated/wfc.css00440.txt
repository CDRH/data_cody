      <span class="salute">Dear <span class="persName">George</span>—</span>


      <p>See my letter to <span class="persName">Alger</span>— as feed is so high in Basin<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> better wait till about Sep 1st before commencing work— but have surveying done this month. I <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="can't​ ">cant</a>
    ​ find out yet if any surveying has been done. I suppose that south line had been surveyed from <u>Head</u> 
         <u>Gate</u>. <span class="persName">Heckart</span> says no. and it will take <span class="persName">Van Dreveldt</span> and three good men not ex bank clerks ten days to do it. So you see I get so many different reports I am completely upset. If you can find out if there has been anything done you can do more than I can— Get <span class="persName">Hymer</span> out of office sure— And <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="let's​ ">lets</a>
    ​ get a man there who can tell the truth at least—</p>

      <p>Under stand Palmer- Capt.<a href="../doc/n03" class="internal_link">3</a> wants in—</p>

      <span class="closer">
