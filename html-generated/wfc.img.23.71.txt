   <p>Frederic Remington had a long association with his friend, William F. Cody. He visited Cody's Wild West exhibitions on a number of occasions, using the visits to sketch western subjects. Remington produced this painting along with several other illustrations for the biography of Cody, Last of the Great Scouts, written by his sister Helen Cody Wetmore in 1899.</p>
