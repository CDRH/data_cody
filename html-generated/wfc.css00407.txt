as he would have answered it, Cody is across the water sailed the morning Fred died, he was with his sister Clara when he heard the news in London, have not heard from him since I am selling off every thing and trying to get things in money where I will live god only knows. have to stay here a while? May go to California, its to early yet to tell have to settle the state first</p>

      <p>Well did you think I had to raise another family have been doing since Cody died snow 4 in to day but I am getting taken care of by the man I got in hotel. it is worlds wonder Fred and Irma died and I left with children Cody has left nothing Fred and Irma 4,000. I will know more when I settle up all though people here says I will not want. With love—</p>
