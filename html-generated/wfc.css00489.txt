   <div class="note">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Dayton, Ohio, on July 5, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "Dayton, Ohio. / Sunday, July 5. Arrived in town at 3.30 A. M. Two-mile haul to lot. Everything was put up in the morning. J. T. McCaddon, Jule Keen, Fred and Charles Hutchinson, and Orator J. J. McCarthy went to Cincinnati and paid a visit to the Pawnee Bill Wild West Show. They were entertained by Pawnee Bill, May Lillie, and Chief of Cowboys Heck Quinn, who is an old Wild West man. Annie Oakley remained over in Piqua last evening and joined us again to-day. James P. Anderson was seen sitting in the marque to-day for several hours figuring faithfully: he left the ground covered with paper and one piece was picked up containing the following figures: 4 days 96 hours, 5,760 minutes, 345,600 seconds. It was passed around the camp all day and no one solved the problem until it came to Mrs. George Fursman, of the Annex; to her, she said, it was as plain as day, and that Mr. Anderson was going home to Columbus, Ohio, next Friday, to see his wife. She was correct, for he left on Friday for Columbus. Heavy rain at 2 P. M., which lasted until 4 P. M. Orders were issued to-day that no employee would be allowed to ride on wagons either to or from lots."</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: The "Young Lady" to whom Cody refers is Daisy May Sorrenson, a young woman who was a teacher in Marquette, Wyoming, and whom Beck hired to work for Shoshone Irrigation Company.  Beck later married Sorrenson in Red Lodge, Montana, December 1, 1897; they had three children: Betty (born 1898, later Mrs. Doyle and Mrs. J. M. Roberson), Jane (born 1900, later Mrs. Nelson T.

   <div class="note">Note 5: Sage Creek lies east of Cody, Wyoming, trending north-south and flowing into the Shoshone River northeast of Cody.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 6: "Irma" likely refers to Irma Flats, an area in the South Fork Valley outside Cody, Wyoming, that was named after Cody's daughter, Irma.  </div>
