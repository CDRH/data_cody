         <em class="hi">BUFFALO BILL GOING TO LONDON.</em>
      </h3>
      <p>Buffalo Bill and his band of Indians, Mexicans, and cowboys will leave Staten Island on Sept. 25. The season has been very successful. Buffalo Bill says that he is worn out with the hard work of a long season, and many of the Indians, the novelty of Eastern life having worn off, are anxious to get a glimpse of their reservations. Messrs. Cody &amp; <span class="persName">Salsbury</span>, the proprietors of the Wild West show, have secured six acres of space at the American Exhibition to be held in London in 1887. They will take their entire show across the Atlantic. They will be absent about two years, and during that period will give performances in the leading cities of Europe.</p>
