      <h3>BUFFALO BILL IN "MOVIES"</h3>
        
        <h3>VENERABLE SCOUT WILL REPRODUCE BEFORE CAMERAS ALL BIG BATTLES OF THE PLAINS IN WHICH HE PARTICIPATED.</h3>
        
        <p>Colonel Cody, F. G. Bonfils and H. H. Tammen have incorporated the Col. W. F. Cody Buffalo Bill Historical Picture Co. Interested with the above named in the project is George K. Spoor of the Essanay Film Mfg. Co., a contract with the Essanay company for the producing of the films having been closed on Wednesday.</p>
        
        <p>Fifty thousand dollars cash has been subscribed as a working capital, but it is expected that the total cost of the series of films will greatly exceed this amount, as expense is not to be considered in the undertaking.</p>
        
        <p>It is the intention of the Col. W. F. Cody Buffalo Bill Historical Film Co., to reproduce the biggest Indian battle scenes on a greater scale than heretofore attempted including the last stand of the Cheyennes, the battles of the Wounded Knee, the Little Big Horn, the Mission and all other big engagements in which Colonel Cody took part.</p>
        
        <p>The Essanay company now have some of their men at Cody, Wyo., and they will take pictures of Cody's home life, Prince Monaco's hunting trip with Colonel Cody, western sports, etc.</p>
        
        <p>Colonel Cody and the moving picture outfit will start on October 1 for the Pine Ridge Agency, where the big battle scenes will be reproduced. The help of practically all of the important officers, and others who are alive who played a real part in the battles has been assured, as well as that of hundreds of Indians and soldiers. Newspaper representative [sic] from nearly every important paper in the country have been invited and it is expected that many will attend.</p>
