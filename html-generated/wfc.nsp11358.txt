      <h3>There's Sanguine Warfare on, But It's in "Movies"</h3>
    
      <p>History was re-enacted in the Tabor Grand theater Sunday. The Indians clashed with soldiers and scenes of warfare ensued, alright, alright.</p>
    
      <p>"Buffalo Bill" (Col. Wm. F. Cody) introduced his moving pictures of the principal Indian battles from 1876 to 1891 when the last rebellion took place, with a short explanation of the idea that prompted the venture and the object of the pictures.</p>
    
      <p>Hundreds of school children and adults crowded the theater.</p>
    
      <p>Reel after reel of films showed the Indians in camp, dancing the war dances, their scouting the alkali plains for unprotected white settlers, the attack and their final annihilation by the United States troops. The final uprising of the reservation Indians against the authority of the "Great White Father" at Washington is graphically pictured. The pictures will be shown all week.</p>
