      <p>Yours of the 18th recd. You cannot possibly regret <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="closing​ ">closeing</a>
    ​ down more than I do— And I feel sure <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="it's​ ">its</a>
    ​ the worst possible thing that could happen the <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="enterprise​ ">enterprize</a>
    ​. But I <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="can't​ ">cant</a>
    ​ carry it alone— <span class="persName">Salsbury</span> has come up like a little stayer— But the others refuse to put up annother dollar— I hope your letter to them will bring good results— You see the Ditch has cost so much more than <del>than</del> they were told it has discouraged thim. We work month after month on the Canal— and the estimates to finish to the Town<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> gets higher— Honestly I <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="can't​ ">cant</a>
    ​ see any headway our force is <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="making​ ">makeing</a>
    ​ they must be working to a disadvantage or else they are loafing on you— I see McGrath<a href="../doc/n03" class="internal_link">3</a> has taken his invalid wife away George why did you not settle
