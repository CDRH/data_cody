      <h3>The Wild West Did a Big Business Despite Contrary Reports.</h3>
      <span class="byline">SPECIAL CABLE TO THE INQUIRER.</span>
      <span class="byline">[By Dunlap Cable Company.]</span>

      <p>PARIS, Sept. 23&#x97;<span class="persName">Major Burke</span>, the manager of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, has just arrived here. He says: "The show is now at Cologne. It did a large business last week in Bremen, as it has done throughout Germany. It has been a great success everywhere, especially in the Rhine country.</p>

      <p>"Colonel Cody and <span class="persName">Nate Salsbury</span> are both greatly annoyed at the false cable reports which were recently sent from Hamburg about the show in that city. The truth is the Wild West played for two weeks there to big receipts. There has been no trouble whatever, and the citizens have asked us to pay a return visit."</p>

      <p>Probably after another month the Wild West will settle down for the winter in Strasbourg, although large offers have been made to the management to play during the season in Paris.</p>
