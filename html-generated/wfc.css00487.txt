      <p>In yours of 23d you say you sent me a statement. If you did I have not recd it. I am to meet the Buffalo people<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> in Chicago And we are going to come to an understanding. We <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="can't​ ">cant</a>
    ​ go on this way. None of us are satisfied. And we <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="can't​ ">cant</a>
    ​ find out what is contracted to be done what has been or where the money has gone. <span class="persName">Alger</span> has been sent for also <span class="persName">Mead</span>. The Buffalo parties ordered this meeting and informed me to day this haphazard way of doing business <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="won't​ ">wont</a>
    ​ do. There has got to be some system which does not exist now. I feel sorry for Flood <a href="../doc/n03" class="internal_link">3</a>
