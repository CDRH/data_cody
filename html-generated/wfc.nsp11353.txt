      <h3>INDIAN WARS</h3>
        
      <span class="l">The Indian wars for fifty years</span>
      <span class="l">On stream and vale and hill</span>
      <span class="l">Are now produced with moving slides</span>
      <span class="l">By brilliant Buffalo Bill!</span>
        
      <span class="l">And here we see the ghost dance craze</span>
      <span class="l">Where Indians plan to kill</span>
      <span class="l">The cavalry of Uncle Sam</span>
      <span class="l">When led by Buffalo Bill!</span>
        
      <span class="l">And in the Miles campaign we see</span>
      <span class="l">Baldwin o'er rock and rill,</span>
      <span class="l">While shooting down the Indian braves</span>
      <span class="l">Charging with bold Buffalo Bill!</span>
        
      <span class="l">And here is Merritt, Carr, and King,</span>
      <span class="l">With troops of desperate will,</span>
      <span class="l">That slashed the Indians right and left</span>
      <span class="l">In front with Buffalo Bill!</span>
        
      <span class="l">Pine Ridge and Wounded Knee can tell,</span>
      <span class="l">And also old Fort Sill,</span>
      <span class="l">How troopers over mount and plain</span>
      <span class="l">Dashed on with Buffalo Bill!</span>
        
      <span class="l">And when their chief, bold Yellow Hand,</span>
      <span class="l">Challenged with hate and skill,</span>
      <span class="l">He met his fate instanter</span>
      <span class="l">And fell by Buffalo Bill!</span>
        
      <span class="l">And Sitting Bull at last defied</span>
      <span class="l">Our troops with tyrant will,</span>
      <span class="l">But soon was killed in action</span>
      <span class="l">By Miles and Buffalo Bill!</span>
