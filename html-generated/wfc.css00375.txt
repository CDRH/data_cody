Mr. C. E. Perkins
President, Burlington, Iowa.

<span class="salute">Dear Sir:—</span>


      <p>Referring to your letter of January 29th, relative to the terminus of our Toluca line.</p>

      <p>I enclose herewith copy of a letter dated 4th instant from Mr. Calvert, with blue prints attached, referring to this matter.  I would recommend for the reasons which he gives that we should construct the line to a point upon the north side of the Stinking Water river opposite Cody, and would suggest that Mr. Morrill might arrange with Mr. Cody and the owners of the townsite at that point to move across the river and to become interested in the new site.  It would seem to me very probably that the development of mining prospects in the Sunlight Basin 30 or 40 miles west of Cody will justify the construction of the road to the point marked “E” on the blue print in the near future, and I do not think that the additional expense required to cross the river to reach the present site of Cody and re-cross for the proposed extension west of Cody would be justifiable under all of the circumstances as they now appear.</p>

      <p>I will be glad to know what you think best to do about this matter when you come to a conclusion.  It would seem to me important that we should decide soon, and that Mr. Morrill should make necessary arrangements for ground for the terminus.</p>

         <br/>G. W. Holdrege
