  <span class="salute">Dear Sir</span>




      <p>In reply to your favor of Jan 14th 1916 — Will say The reason <del>the</del> of the long delay for the delivery of the Indian War Pictures was that I was in the west. But in December last I took the Reels my self to Washington. I called at Secretary Lanes<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> office. But failing to find him I called on Secretary Garrison<a href="../doc/n03" class="internal_link">3</a>. And left the Reels or Films with his Secretary who promised to notify Secretary Lane that he had a set of the Reels or films for his department. If you will kindly communicate <del>with</del> with the Secretary to Secretary Garrison, I think you will find everything allright.</p>
