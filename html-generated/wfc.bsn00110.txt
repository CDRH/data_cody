      <span class="persName">Mr. Bronson Rumsey</span>, Trustee,

696 Ellicott Square,

Buffalo, New York,


<span class="salute">Dear Sir:-</span>


      <p>Herewith statement showing business transacted with respect to our joint interests at Cody, Wyoming, for the six months ending Dec. 31st, 1928.</p>

      <p>You will note there is standing to the credit of the Trustee, at this date, $14,064.86. From this amount we have deducted $2,009.27, being the Lincoln Land Company's 1/7 share of the same, and a like amount which is the 1/7 share of the Estate of W. F. Cody. This Estate is indebted to the Lincoln Land Company and we have applied this share to the credit of the Estate. I also enclose a check for $8,000.00, being the amount to be divided to the remaining 5/7. You will note that we still retain $2,046.32 to the credit of the Trustee which is to insure the payment of taxes soon to mature and also to take care of expense of law-suit now pending against the property.</p>

      <p>Will you be kind enough to sign and remail the voucher.</p>


      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours very truly,</span>


         <br/>W. W. Turner<br/>

Sec'y. &amp; Treas.
