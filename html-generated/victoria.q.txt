      <div class="note">Victoria, Queen of Great Britain (1819-1901), was celebrating the Golden Jubilee, marking the fiftieth year of her reign during the summer of 1887. The Wild West capitalized on her patronage in its marketing. In addition to a private performance in the early days of the London season at Earls Court, the exhibition gave a command performance for the Queenâ€™s guests on the eve of her Jubilee. </div>
