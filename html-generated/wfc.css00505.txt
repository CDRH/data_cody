   <div class="note">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Mankato, Minnesota, on September 18, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "Mankato, Minn. / Friday, Sept. 18. Arrived in town at 5 A. M. One-mile haul to the lot. Weather very unfavorable, cloudy and threatening all day, with high wind, and turned very cold at night. Wm. Sweeney, Leader of the Cowboy Band, went hunting this afternoon, and as Schaffer, of Schaffer and Clarke, says, "shot a rabbit with his rusty gun." This is the first hunt of the season. Pedro Esqueval received a fall this afternoon; it resulted in a sprained shoulder. / This town has a population of 12,000 and no street cars. / Business, big in the afternoon, fair at night. / Lot, Main street, C., St. P., M. &amp; O. R. R. / Arena, 186 x 359."</div>
