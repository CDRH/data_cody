      <span class="persName">Mr. Bronson C. Rumsey</span>,

Ellicott Square,

Buffalo, N. Y.


<span class="salute">Dear Sir:</span>

      <p>I have purchased from the sisters of the late <span class="persName">H. C. Alger</span> all of the remaining assets of his estate, and in this purchase received an assignment of his one-fourteenth interest in the Cody Town-site, which is in a trusteeship with you as trustee.</p>

      <p>I enclose herewith the assignment together with a certified copy of Mr. Alger's will, and also certified copy of the order of the District Court decreeing the title <del>interest</del> in Mr. Alger's sisters. Please furnish me with evidence of transfer.</p>

      <p>In your letter of November 23rd to Mr. Perkins, he tells me that you asked that the other owners in this proposition be given an opportunity to purchase this interest, and I wish to say that if you desire, I would be glad to receive from you a proposition for such purchase, realizing that you would prefer undoubtedly to keep this interest within the original owners. I will be glad to entertain any proposition you may make. </p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Very truly,</span>


         <br/>E B Allan
