      <h3>AN ADMIRER OF "BUFFALO BILL."</h3>
      <p>Cecil James Eugene Harvey, 14 years of age, was charged at the Mansion House, yesterday, with embezzling £5, the property of his master, Mr. C. R. Bonney, 41, Eastcheap. The prisoner had been an office-boy in Mr. Bonney's employ, and was sent to the City Bank in Aldgate to cash a cheque for £5. He absconded, and was found by Detective Harding at Manchester on Friday night, and brought to town. On the warrant being read to him, he said he had spent all the money, and added, "Some time ago I went to see Buffalo Bill at the Wild West Show, in South Kensington. I was very much struck with the life, and from that moment I made up my mind to go to America, and as soon as I got the cheque cashed I made off, but, not having enough to get to America, I followed Buffalo Bill to Manchester, and have been at the show every day. I still intend to go to America, and even if I should get 10 years for this offence I shall go afterwards."—The Lord Mayor remanded the prisoner, who declined to ask any questions.</p>
