         <strong>Buffalo Bill to Live in Pictures</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>H. Tammen and F. J. Bonfils, proprietors of the Denver Post and of the Sells-Floto shows, have arranged to engage in the manufacture of moving pictures.  On Thursday, August 21, at Denver, they purchased all the best animals and equipment of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, the sale of all the belongings of the historic organization being held on that date.</p>
      <p>Fifty thousand dollars was immediately set aside for the production of the first of a series of multiple feature reels, in which the early life of Buffalo Bill, the scout and soldier, will be closely and truthfully followed in pictures, he himself to appear as the principal figure.  It is said that Indians and soldiers will be massed in great numbers in these pictures, and that early frontier life will be realistically portrayed.  A studio for the production of interior scenes will soon be erected in Denver, according to reliable information.</p>
