   <div class="note">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Madison, Wisconsin, on August 26, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "Madison, Wis. / Wednesday, August 26. Arrived in town at 7.15 A. M., which was very early considering the long haul of last night, and a delay of forty minutes in a freight yard on account of a fire in a storage house near the track. Manager McCaddon, Fred. Hutchinson and J. W. Murray, of the "Fu-kort" Fishing Club, went fishing after the afternoon show and returned with forty of the finest kind of lake bass. They all swore that they caught them, and as there was no proof to the contrary it was declared around the camp to be the most successful fishing excursion of the season. Driver Edward Fletcher, who fell from his wagon in Milwaukee, died at three o'clock this afternoon at the Emergency Hospital. / Business big. Lot, Fair Grounds. / Arena, 193 x 362."</div>
