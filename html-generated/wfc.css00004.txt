      <span class="dateline">Pine Ridge Agency, S. D.

July 28, 1913</span>

      <span class="salute">Hon. Commissioner of Indian Affairs,<br/>
Washington, D. C.<br/>
Sir:—<br/>
      </span>


      <p>I am enclosing herewith letter, addressed to me, William Cody; at statement of amounts due Indians (statement handed to me by one of the show Indians, which he said had been given him by one of the men in charge, after attachment) a newspaper clipping, which is self-explanatory, and copies of contracts with Pine Ridge Indians.</p>

      <p>I would respectfully request that your Office take up, with the Department of Justice, the matter of having the proper U. S. Attorney look after the Indians' interests in the settlement of the affairs of the disbanded show. The contracts are not covered by bond and it is probable that some legal action will be necessary to secure to the Indians their rights in the settlement of the affairs of the show company.</p>
