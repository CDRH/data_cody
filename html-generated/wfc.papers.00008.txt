      <h3>Buffalo Bill's Great Plains, 1846-1879</h3>

      <h3>Paul A. Olson Seminars in Great Plains Studies
Lincoln, Nebraska, January 18, 2012</h3>

      <span class="byline">By Douglas Seefeldt, University of Nebraska-Lincoln</span>

      <p>In this presentation, Seefeldt will share some of the findings from "Mapping Buffalo Bill's Great Plains," a digital history research project that examines and displays multiple perspectives on Great Plains history via the lens of the early life and times of William F. "Buffalo Bill" Cody. By contextualizing key events from Cody's 1879 autobiography, Seefeldt shows how Cody's Great Plains experiences move beyond the legendary and demonstrates the important role the region played in territorial expansion, the Indian Wars, environmental change, American commercial and technological progress and their concomitant legacies.</p>
