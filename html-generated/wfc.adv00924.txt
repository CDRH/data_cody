         <h3>The Life of Buffalo Bill</h3>

         <p>WE are offering to the purchaser of state rights for this set of pictures an investment that will be earning dividends for years.</p>

         <p>Why? Because they perpetuate a great personality. A character that is indelibly identified with American History. The older they grow the more valuable they become. Some day they will be priceless.</p>

         <p>An educational feature with all the thrill of real Western life. A truthful record of the life of the only surviving hero of the Indian Wars. Colonel Cody is the last of a vanishing type of pioneers who passed into history before the invasion of Motography.</p>

         <p>There is only one Buffalo Bill. For thirty years his name has been a drawing card all over the world. When he is gone these pictures will have to take his place. Do you need any stronger argument than that? Be wise. Buy it NOW.</p>

      <div class=" ">
         <p>STATE RIGHT MEN CONSIDER THIS: We are offering a picture that will draw at sight. Beautiful Lithographs in several sizes and kinds — now being prepared by the Courier Co. of Buffalo, New York.</p>

         <p>REMEMBER — This is not a reproduction of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, nor is it a Western dramatic picture. It is an authorized and authentic story of the life of Colonel William F. Cody, from the age of 12 until the present time.</p>

         <p>Bear in mind, we give to each purchaser of state rights a written guarantee that these pictures are genuine, and exactly as represented. We also guarantee full legal protection to any of our clients against invasion of territory.</p>

         <p>Bid now while the bidding is good. Be in on the Gold Rush. Secure the rights for the best states. Now is the time. An even start for everybody. Don't lag behind until everything is gone.</p>
