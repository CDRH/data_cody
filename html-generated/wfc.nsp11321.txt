      </div>
        
        <p>These pictures have the transcendent merit of being presented by veteran participants thus having the value of AUTHENTICITY, PERSONALITY, FAITHFUL PORTRAYAL WITH GOVERNMENTAL APPROVAL of effective collated episodes of TRAILING, FINDING, FIGHTING — IN SKIRMISH and BATTLE — directed in detail by those who witnessed and were engaged in the Melees, assisted by all the SKILL AND INGENUITY THE ESSANAY COMPANY EXPERTS COULD DEVISE — in simply reproducing events in the last days OF THE LAST THREE DECADES of the CENTURIES OF BATTLE BETWEEN THE RED AND WHITE MAN FROM THE SANGUINARY CAMPAIGNS OF THE '60s — the General E. A. Carr victory at Summitt Springs in 1869, when Scout Cody killed Chief Tall Bull; of the '70s — the bloody fight at War Bonnet Creek in 1876 (Custer's Campaign), in which Buffalo Bill, in personal duel, dispatched Chief Yellow Hand.</p>
        
        <p>The death of CHIEF SITTING BULL to the GHOST DANCE, continental-wide rebellion craze.</p>
        
        <p>THE INDIANS' LAST STAND — WOUNDED KNEE and THE MISSION, 1890 and 1891 — tragic deaths of Captain Wallace, Lieutenant Mann, wounding of Lieutenants Gurlington, Hawthorne, McKimie and Father Craft.</p>
        
        <p>Depicted on the actual battle ground, with the living personages who cover a half century of the story, ably and mutely, repeating it with realistic vividness, as it then was — thus adding LIFE BLOOD TO ART.</p>
        
        <p>ECHOES FROM PINE RIDGE — REELS OF REAL HISTORY FILMS — NOTED MEN IN NATIONAL NARRATIVE — THE OLD GUARD IN THE SADDLE LED BY THAT DISTINGUISHED CIVIL FRONTIER AND SPANISH WAR BATTLE VETERAN-SOLDIER</p>
