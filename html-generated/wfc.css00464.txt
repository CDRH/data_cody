         <a name="n01.note"> </a>Note 1: En route to Cody, Wyoming, and likely provisioning in Billings, Cody inscribes this letter to Beck on letterhead from "P. Yegen &amp; Co. Billings, Montana." Christian and Peter Yegen emigrated from Switzerland in 1879 and 1881, respectively. In 1882 they relocated to Billings and opened their store selling all types of provisions to ranchers and settlers in the surrounding area.<a href="#n01.ref"> [back]</a>

Cody writes directly to Flood on May 22, 1896 (CSS00485) regarding poor treatment of Cody's livestock. Flood's association with Cody is not fully known, but Cody states he is "...about through with Mr. Flood."<a href="#n04.ref"> [back]</a>
