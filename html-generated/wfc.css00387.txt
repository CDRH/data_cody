   <div class="note">Note 1: Cody was in Omaha exhibiting his motion picture <em class="hi">The Indian Wars</em> for a week-long run. According to the <em class="hi">Omaha World-Herald</em> on March 17, 1914, the theater had been filled to capacity for both showings the previous day. "Dutton" may refer to either Samuel F. Dutton (born c. 1869), who was then the proprietor of the Albany Hotel in Denver, or his younger brother Frank R. Dutton, who helped manage the hotel. The Dutton brothers were pallbearers at Cody's funeral in 1917.</div>
