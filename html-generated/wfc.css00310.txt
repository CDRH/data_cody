      <p>Your welcome Letter<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> of July10th. received, and I was glad to hear from you, so far we have had a <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="very​ ">verry</a>
    ​ tough season, it has simply rained all the time so to speak.</p>

      <p>I am <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="enclosing​ ">encloseing</a>
    ​ you my Route but I cant say positively if I will be away from the Show a few days or not, as there are going to be great doings at Cody Wyoming the latter part of July, and the first days of August, as Automobiles are <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="permitted​ ">permited</a>
    ​ to enter The Park on Aug.1st. and of course all my people out there want be to be there at this opening, as it is myself who found <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="wear​ ">whear</a>
    ​ a wagon road could be built from the Town of Cody into Yellow Stone Park, and it was through my efforts, that I persuaded United States Gov. to build this Road, and my friends want me to be the first men to the Park by Automobile, in other words to lead the Procession.<a href="../doc/n03" class="internal_link">3</a>
      </p>

      <p>I note what you say in regards to our Arizona Mines and I have two prospective buyers there at the present time. The Tungsten Mines seems to be the favorite over the Gold at the present time owing to the high price of Tungsten.<a href="../doc/n04" class="internal_link">4</a>
      </p>

      <p>I have not <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="forgotten​ ">forgoten</a>
    ​ you for a moment, but the Show <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Business​ ">Buissness</a>

   <div class="note">Note 1: Although Cody did not include the year in this dateline, this letter is believed to have been written in 1915.  Cody appeared with the Sells-Floto Circus in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on July 19, 1915.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: It appears that Cody wrote the word "Letter" by hand over the typed word "Paper."</div>

   <div class="note">Note 3: According to historian Robert E. Bonner, credit for laying out the first wagon road from the town of Cody to Yellowstone National Park should go to <span class="persName">George Beck</span>. Although William F. Cody publicly announced his intention to ride in the first private automobile to enter the park, he did not actually attend the formal opening of automobile traffic in Yellowstone on August 1, 1915.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 4: The "prospective buyers" Cody mentions here remain unidentified. Cody was never able to sell his underperforming Arizona mines during his lifetime.</div>
