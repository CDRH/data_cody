<span class="salute">Dear Clarence:</span>




      <p>Your two letters of Sept. 27 and 29 I received on my return from the mountain hunts, I want you to remember, my dear friend, that it is no pleasure job to organize these big hunting parties. It is just about the hardest work a man can do.; but I enjoyed it very much. Both the Prince of Monaco<a href="../doc/n01" class="internal_link">1</a> and Gates'<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> party are now hunting in the mountains. I could not remain with them for the reason that I am leaving today for Pine Ridge, South Dakota, where I will be for the next 3 or 4 weeks. I am certainly in the lime light now if I ever was, and I will certainly keep it up because these moving pictures<a href="../doc/n03" class="internal_link">3</a> we are about to take will perpetuate me for future generations as well as for the present. We will probably produce these great pictures in Madison Square Garden during the winter and I am to lecture on each one of these battles. I wish that you could interest capital enough to handle the Cody Dyer mines<a href="../doc/n04" class="internal_link">4</a>. However, you must excuse me now as I am about to catch this train. You will <del>no</del> know where to write me and we will keep in touch with each other; as something might come up whereby you could fit in to<del>o</del> good advantage.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Your friend,</span>
         <br/>W. F. Cody

  <div class="note">Note 1: Prince of Monaco was Albert I (1848-1922), who visited Cody, Wyoming, as William F. Cody's guest on a game hunt during October 1913. Prince Albert was the first sitting monarch to visit the United States, ultimately visiting President William Howard Taft in Washington, D.C., as an official state visitor on October 20, 1913.</div>
  <div class="note">Note 2: Charles Gilbert Gates (1876-1913), was the only son of John Warne Gates, known as "Bet-a-Million" Gates, a pioneer promoter of barbed wire. Charles Gates, nicknamed "Spend-a-Million" Gates, had hoped to join the hunt with Prince Albert I but arrived in Cody too late. Instead, guided by Cody local Ned Frost and accompanied by an entourage including two physicians, Gates arranged his own 33-day hunt. Following this hunt, Gates retired to his private rail car in Cody and was later found dead.</div>
  <div class="note">Note 3: Filming of <em class="hi">The Indian Wars</em> was done on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota in October 1913. Unfortunately, Cody's motion picture (as did almost all motion pictures of the time) used nitrate film stock, which disintegrates over time and is highly flammable. Only small fragments of Cody's film are reported to still be in existence.</div>
  <div class="note">Note 4: Cody-Dyer Mines was the mining venture near Tucson, Arizona, co-owned with <span class="persName">Daniel Burns Dyer</span>. In 1912 the partners realized that the earnings from their mines were unlikely to recoup their initial investments. Dyer died soon thereafter.</div>
