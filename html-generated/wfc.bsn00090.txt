<span class="salute">Dear Mr. Gerrans:</span>

      <p>I enclose a copy of our Profit and Loss Account. You will see that it shows a net profit of $21530.43. We had a very good year last year. Our profit was even greater than I expected, but I do think we are doing better than we ever have.</p>

      <p>I am not going into detail in this letter, regarding the various phases. I am quite sure that I will have to go to Chicago and I will drop down and go over the whole thing and have the statement complete. Unless something comes up that I don't know of now I will be in Buffalo in a couple of weeks, as I do think getting to Chicago I would like to come on and go over things with you and <span class="persName">Mr. Rumsey</span>.</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours truly,</span>
