      <h3>To Sleep on the Happy Hunting Grounds.</h3>

      <p>
         <span class="persName">Kills-Many</span> or Killed-His-Pony, the young Indian who died of consumption at Bellevue Hospital yesterday, will sleep his last sleep in the land of the Red Men. He was a Sioux of the Lacotah tribe, and thanks to the kind interest of the Hon. W. F. Cody, <span class="persName">Gen. J. R. O'Beirne</span> and <span class="persName">George C. Crager</span>, a Sioux interpreter, engaged Undertaker Michael P. Daly, who took the remains from the Morgue to-day. To-night they will be sent by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad to Pine Ridge, Dakota, when they will be taken to the primeval wilderness and interred with Sioux rites.</p>
