      <h3>NOTED INDIAN BATTLES FAITHFULLY DEPICTED</h3>
        <div class=" ">
        <h4>Verdict of Those Who Have Witnessed the Movie Pictures Produced by Col. Cody.</h4>
        
        <p>That the famous Indian battles as represented in the motion pictures brought to this city by Col. William F. Cody, popularly known as "Buffalo Bill," are true to life and realistic, was the opinion voiced by the large number of persons who witnessed their exhibition yesterday. The pictures were shon [sic] in the afternoon at the Columbia Theater, under the auspices of the National Press Club and last night at the Home Club. In both gatherings were a number of persons prominent in this country, and several old indian fighters and civil war veterans were included.</p>
        
        <p>Col. Cody, who personally told of the work of making the pictures and the difficulties attendant thereon, explained that no attempt was made to obtain fine stagecraft, but that the only point made was to have them historically correct.</p>
