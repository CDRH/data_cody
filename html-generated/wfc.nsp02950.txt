      <h3>WILL NOT SIGN.</h3>
      <h3>Buffalo Bill's Indians are Not Selling Their Lands Just Now.</h3>

      <p>The Indian Bureau has information that the Sioux now in Europe with the Wild West combination refuse to sign the agreement selling their reservation. As they are from Pine Ridge, this action was fully expected. This chief has been consistently fighting the opening of the reservation for several years.</p>
