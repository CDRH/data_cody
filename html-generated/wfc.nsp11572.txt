      <h3>"LITTLE SURE SHOT'S" ALL RIGHT.</h3>

      <p>The newspapers throughout the land recently published the heartrending particulars of the death of <span class="persName">Miss Annie Oakley</span>, otherwise known as "Little Sure Shot," who gained name and fame as a markswoman and who holds a "Police Gazette" trophy as an emblem of her unerring aim. Many of the journals gave the minutest particulars of the sad deathbed scenes.</p>

      <p>This letter dispels all controversy regarding the matter:

                  <p>
                     <em class="hi">Dear Sir</em>—The papers all over Europe have been publishing the death of Annie Oakley, and, I suppose, before this it has got in the American press. It has caused us much trouble answering letters, telegrams and cablegrams. Will you kindly contradict it in your largely-circulated paper and oblige her by doing so. Miss Oakley is in the best of health enjoying her vacation in shooting game. She joins Buffalo Bill in April. Yours very truly.</p>
