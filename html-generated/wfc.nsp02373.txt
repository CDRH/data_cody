                <p>"The Spoilers" is being done to big houses again this week.  Next week, the Seventh and Twelfth United States Cavalry, under the direction of Lieut.-Gen. Nelson A. Miles, Brig.-Gen. Frank Baldwin, Maj.-Gen. Jesse M. Lee, Gen. Marion P. Maus, Col. W. C. Sickels and the chief of scouts, Col. W. F. Cody ("Buffalo Bill,") engaged with their old-time red antagonists, the Sioux, the Brules, and the Cheyennes, will realistically re-enact the series of battles that finally ended Indian wars in this country.</p>
