And I think you ought to work a force large enough to work to <del>d</del> Advantage at least— As you have a stenographer<a href="../doc/n04" class="internal_link">4</a> paid by the Co. You should let each member of the Co know <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="what's​ ">whats</a>
    ​ going on. And tell them what you would like to do— that would be of benefit to Co. &amp;c— As <span class="persName">Alger</span> has paid Paxton &amp; Co<a href="../doc/n05" class="internal_link">5</a>

And as you have to keep men to run the store. If you can <u>sell</u> anything to advantage how would it do to buy a small stock of goods on <u>90</u> days time? <span class="persName">Eddy</span> writes he has wholesale prices from different firms. here tofore we have been buying to high. if goods <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="can't​ ">cant</a>
    ​ be bought right there will be no <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="profit​ ">proffit</a>
    ​. Salsbury writes thinks Bonds can be placed after Election. Wish you would write Buffalo parties what you owe out there and that people are worrying you for their pay— it might help to get them to exert their selves. As it pretty tough on two of us to carry this <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Enterprise​ ">Enterprize</a>

We had a series of small things happen on our run to-night; among them was the falling of a brake-rod and a bad flat wheel, which delayed us so that we did not get into town until 6.30 A. M. One-mile haul to lot. Edward C. Wiebe, of the electric-light department, left to-day to join the Augustine Neuville Dramatic Company, at Louisville, Ky. John Curly left again to-night to go to the hospital in Milwaukee. James Rushenberger returned to-day from St. Luke's Hospital, Chicago. Indian Two Dog and wife closed to-day and left for Pine Ridge Agency to-night. M. Coyle, excursion agent and railroad manager, was with us to-day. To-night closes one of the best weeks of the season, so far as a financial basis is considered/ Weather warm, and everything that could be desired. / Business good at both performances. / Lot, Fair Grounds. / Arena, 187 x 363."</div>
