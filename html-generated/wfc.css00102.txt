      <p>Thanks for finding out about those hot springs near Cody— now what I want to know is what the State proposes to do with them.<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> You know I am working hard to establish a Military College in our state— and it will be a great advertisement for the state.<a href="../doc/n03" class="internal_link">3</a> And as I was the first man to make application to the state for those mineral waters I should be <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="considered​ ">considdered</a>
    ​— And as I am bringing the Military College— I should know as soon as possible. Please find out what I can do to get use of those springs.</p>

      <p>And let me know at once—</p>

      <span class="closer">
