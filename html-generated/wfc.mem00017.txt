         <h3>Descriptive Programme of
BUFFALO BILL'S WILD WEST
AMERICA'S NATIONAL ENTERTAINMENT.</h3>

         <div class="milestone part"> </div>

         <p>NOTE.—It is the aim of the management of Buffalo Bill's Wild West to do more than present an exacting and realistic entertainment for public amusement. Their object is to PICTURE TO THE EYE, by the aid of historical characters and living animals, a series of animated scenes and episodes, which had their existence in fact, of the wonderful pioneer and frontier life of the Wild West of America.</p>
         <p>Beginning with the Primeval Forest, peopled by the Indian and Wild Beasts only, the story of the gradual civilisation of a vast continent is depicted. The hardships, daring, and frontier skill of the participants being a guarantee of the faithful reproduction of scenes and incidents in which they have had actual experience.</p>
         <p>The central figure in these pictures is that of THE HON. W. F. CODY (Buffalo Bill), to whose sagacity, skill, energy, and courage, as a Scout, Guide, Frontiersman, and Indian Fighter, the settlers of the West owe so much for the reclamation of the prairie from the savage Indian and wild animals, who so long opposed the march of civilisation.</p>
         <p>Attention to the Orator will materially assist the spectator in his grasp of the leading episodes.</p>

HON. WM. F. CODY,

<p>DEAR CODY,— . . . . . . . . . . In common with all your countrymen, I want to let you know that I am not ony gratified, but proud of your management and general behaviour; so far as I can make out you have been modest, graceful, and dignified in all you have done to illustrate the history of civilisation on this Continent during the past century.</p>
         <p>I am especially pleased with the graceful and pretty compliment paid you by the Princess of Wales, who rode with you in the Deadwood Coach while it was attacked by the Indians, and rescued by the cowboys. Such things did occur in our days, and may never again.</p>
         <p>As near as I can estimate there were <em class="hi">in</em> 1865 <em class="hi">about nine and a half millions of buffaloes</em> on the plains between the Missouri River and the Rocky Mountains, all are now gone—killed for their meat, their skins, and bones.</p>
         <p>This seems like desecration, cruelty, and murder, yet they have been replaced by twice as many <em class="hi">neat</em> cattle. At that date there were about 165,000 <em class="hi">Pawnees, Sioux, Cheyennes, Kiowas, and Araphahoes</em>, who depended on these buffaloes for their yearly food. They, too, are gone, and have been replaced by twice or thrice as many white men and women, who have made the earth to blossom as the rose, and who can be counted, taxed, and governed by the laws of nature and civilisation. This change has been salutary, and will go on to the end. You have caught one epoch of the world's history, have illustrated it in the very heart of the modern world—London, and I want you to feel that on this side the water we appreciate it.</p>
         <p>This drama must end; days, years, and centuries follow fast, even the drama of civilisation must have an end.</p>
         <p>All I aim to accomplish on this sheet of paper is to assure you that I fully recognise your work, and that the presence of the Queen, the beautiful Princess of Wales, the Prince, the British public, are marks of favour which reflect back on America sparks of light which illuminate many a house and cabin in the land where once <em class="hi">you guided me honestly and faithfully in</em>  1865-6  <em class="hi">from Fort Riley to Kearney in Kansas and Nebraska.</em>

         <span class="ab">[EXTRACT.] </span>
         <p>BUFFALO BILL'S WILD WEST EXHIBITION, which has attracted all the town to West Brompton for the last few months, was brought yesterday to an appropriate and dignified close. A meeting of representative Englishmen and Americans was held, under the presidence of Lord LORNE, in support of the movement for establishing a Court of Arbitration for the settlement of disputes between this country and the United States. At first sight it might seem to be a far cry from the Wild West to an International Court. Yet the connection is not really very remote. They are the effects of increased and increasing intercourse between the two countries, and tend to promote a still more intimate understanding. The Wild West was irresistible. Those who went to be amused often stayed to be instructed. Colonel CODY, much to the astonishment of some of his more superfine compatriots, suddenly found himself the hero of the London season. Notwithstanding his daily engagements and his puntual fulfilment of them, he found time to go everywhere, to see everything, and to be seen by all the world. All London contributed to his triumph, and now the close of his Show is selected as the occasion for promoting a great international movement, with Mr. BRIGHT, Lord GRANVILLE, Lord WOLSELEY, and Lord LORNE for its sponsors. This association of the cause of internatonal arbitration with the fortunes of the Wild West Show has a serious import. After all, the Americans and the English are one stock. Nothing that is American comes altogether amiss to an Englishman. Hence it is no paradox to say that Colonel CODY has done his part in bringing America and England nearer together. The nearer they are brought together the less likely they are to quarrel. Disputes and differences there must occasionally be; but if both parties to a dispute are quite determined not to quarrel over it, it can never become very serious. A serious quarrel between England and the United States would be almost worse than a civil war. Such being the sentiment on both sides, there ought to be no insuperable difficulty in setting up a Court of Arbitration. Colonel CODY can achieve no greater triumph, even if he some day realises the design attributed to him of running the Wild West Show within the classic precincts of the Colosseum at Rome. <em class="hi">Civilisation itself consents to march onward in the train of Buffalo Bill.</em>
