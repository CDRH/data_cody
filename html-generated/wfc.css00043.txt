      <span class="salute">My Dear Boy,</span>



      <p>I will be in Baltimore on the Morning of Oct 19th next Saturday Morning. I arrive by boat from Norfolk Va. Meet me when the boat arrives. You can find out Where the boat lands. And what hour it will be early in the Morning. I will not remain in Baltimore over an hour. And want to see you. I hope you are getting along nicely. Kind regards to your Family.</p>
