Mr. C. E. Perkins,
Pres. Burlington Ry.,
Burlington, Iowa.


<span class="salute">My dear Sir:—</span>


      <p>The citizens of Cody, Wyo., are <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title=" very much​ ">verymuch</a>
    ​  alarmed owing to your surveyors surveying a line on the north side of the Shoshone river opposite the town of Cody.  This survey runs from Corbett to the hot springs, three miles above Cody.  Can I assure residents of Cody that when you do build into that country that you will build to Cody?  You know I have spent six years of time and lots of money to open up that unknown country.</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Very truly yours,</span>
         <br/>W. F. Cody


Address Hoffman House,
New York City.
