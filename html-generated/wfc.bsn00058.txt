      <span class="dateline">April 1st, 1913.</span>





      <span class="persName">Mr. Bronson Rumsey</span>,
  696 Ellicott Square,

  Buffalo, New York,
    

<span class="salute">Dear Sir:-</span>


      <p>Yours of the 18th ultimo, advising us that you were unable to collect from the different joint owners, amount due this Company, on property owned jointly, of which you are Trustee, is received.</p>

      <p>We suppose that, if this is the condition of things, there is nothing left for us to do but to carry the balance charged against it, and charge the usual rate of interest on that balance until it is finally settled.</p>

      <span class="closer">

         <span class="salute">Very truly yours,</span>

         <br/>W. W. Turner.<br/>

Secretary.
