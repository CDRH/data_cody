         <a name="n01.note"> </a>Note 1: Cody did not include the year in his dating of this letter. The digits 191 followed by a blank were preprinted on the hotel stationery. A "4" has been penciled in the blank by an unknown hand. Because the letter describes the production of Cody's film <em class="hi">The Indian Wars</em>, which took place in the fall of 1913, it is more likely to have been written in December 1913 than in 1914.<a href="#n01.ref"> [back]</a>

Prince Albert I of Monaco (1848-1922; reigned 1889-1922) came to northwestern Wyoming for a hunting trip in September 1913. Among other activities on his trip, the prince attended the Park County Fair and hunted with William F. Cody. As Cody indicates in the letter, some of the prince's activities were filmed by Cody's movie crew.<a href="#n06.ref"> [back]</a>
