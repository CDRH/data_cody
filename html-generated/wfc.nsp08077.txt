      <h3>BUFFALO BILL IN EUROPE.</h3>
      <p>LONDON, March 4.&#x97;Buffalo Bill suffered a heavy loss by shipwreck last fall, but the unprecedented engagement of seventeen weeks which his wild west show has just concluded at Glasgow more than compensates him for this loss, it being undoubtedly his greatest success since he first landed on European shores. To-day he installs his show in winter quarters at Earl's Court, where his cowboys and buffaloes and bucks and squaws will be allowed to rest until May 7th next. Chief <span class="persName">Short Bull</span>, one of Mr. Cody's leading men, has been suffering for some time from a severe attack of nervous prostration, but is now reported to be on the road to recovery, and although his life was despaired of a few days ago, he is now able to take short walks about the city.</p>
