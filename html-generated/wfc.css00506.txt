   <div class="note">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Sheldon, Iowa, on September 19, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "Sheldon, Iowa. / Saturday, Sept. 19. Arrived in town at 7 A. M. A good run and a long one, 126 miles. We had one happy man this morning. J. P. Anderson had his hay fever cured by the frost this morning, from which he has been suffering since August 12th. We had two hunting parties this afternoon, Wm. Sweeney, Johnnie Baker, Annie Oakley and Frank Butler. They shot six prairie chicken and one rabbit. The other party was Manager McCaddon and Fred Hutchinson; they went out for big game and came back without anything. / Weather fine to-day, but turned very cold towards night. / This town has 1,800 inhabitants and no street cars. / Business, big in the afternoon, but light at night. / Lot, foot of third street. / Arena, 187 x 351."</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: The year is not inscribed by Cody but is 1896.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 3: The postmistress of the town, Mrs. Marion Williams, filed for a new Post Office under the name of "Shoshone," but the name was rejected by the government because of confusion with Shoshone Agency established in 1870 (in 1937 that name was changed to the Wind River Agency). Mrs. Williams then submitted the name "Richland" for the town; the Post Office accepted this name. However, a meeting was called by important members of the town, and the new name of "Cody" was formally submitted. The government then cancelled the name 'Richland' and in August 1896 formally accepted the name of Cody, Wyoming.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 4: The "Tregos" are Charles Trego (1856-1925) and Carrie Trego (1866-1942); Charles was a personal friend of Cody's and a foreman for both Scout's Rest Ranch in North Platte, Nebraska, and the TE Ranch in Cody, Wyoming. </div>

   <div class="note">Note 5: Red Bluffs, the hill formation to the south and west of Cody, Wyoming, that stands out among the mountainous formations due to its red color.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 6: Cody wanted Beck to petition the State of Wyoming to make Cody the county seat.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 7: Northern Pacific Railway.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 8: "Bear Creek Coal fields" or "Bear Creek Mines,"  located at Bearcreek, Montana, about eight miles southeast of Red Lodge, Montana. In the Bearcreek district small mining operations started in the 1890s. Wagons pulled by horse and mule were used to haul coal to the railroad at Red Lodge. In 1897 the Montana Coal &amp; Iron Company was formed.  By 1907 four major mines were operating; as the mines started producing, the Montana, Wyoming &amp; Southern Railroad laid tracks east of Bearcreek and eventually laid a line to these mines.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 9: Red Lodge, Montana, lies 65 miles north of Cody and was the closest rail line to Cody, Wyoming.</div>
