      <p>The programme which was rendered famous to all Londoners in the Jubilee year was then gone through with, and for the following two hours a capital variety show, in the truest sense of the word, was displayed before the admiring crowd. Prominent features were the incident of the capture of the historical Deadwood Coach—with Buffalo Bill on the box—by a crowd of yelling savages; a representation of Buffalo Bill's single-handed combat with <span class="persName">Yellow Hand</span>, the Sioux Chief; a buffalo hunt, with real live buffaloes; an attack on an emigrant train by Indians, and subsequent repulse by cowboys; and graphic representations of Indian life. The programme also includes exhibitions by four wonderfully clever shootists, including Buffaio Bill, who performed marvels with a repeater rifle by smashing small balls thrown up into the air, and a clever little Yankeee lass named <span class="persName">Annie Oakley</span>, who proved herself a perfect genius with the shooting irons.</p>
