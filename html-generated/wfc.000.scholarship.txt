                <p>The <a href="http://www.codystudies.org/">Cody Studies</a> digital research platform provides a venue for scholars from a variety of backgrounds to explore William F. Cody’s life and Buffalo Bill’s Wild West as an exemplary piece of Americana during an age of high nationalism. As an area of scholarly inquiry, this initiative aims to create a new genre of nineteenth-century digital humanities scholarship that compliments and extends the long tradition of print works that examine the long reach of William F. Cody’s life and his expansive connections to the myriad events of that period both in America and abroad. Here you find a number of <a href="http://www.codystudies.org/?page_id=6">Digital Research</a> modules and works of original <a href="http://www.codystudies.org/?page_id=7">Digital Scholarship</a>, as well as digital companions to new books published in a <a href="http://www.codystudies.org/?page_id=17">Monograph</a> series and new editor’s introductions to volumes published in a scholarly <a href="http://www.codystudies.org/?page_id=15">Editions</a> series with major university presses. The platform also includes a listing of recent scholarly <a href="http://www.codystudies.org/?page_id=13">Presentations</a> of Cody studies research and an authoritative <a href="http://www.codystudies.org/?page_id=13">Historiography</a> of published scholarship from a wide range of disciplines that examine William F. Cody and his world.</p>
