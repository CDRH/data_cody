<span class="salute">Dear Sir:—</span>


      <p>A portion of your letter of the 24 inst. to Prof. has been referred to me for answer.</p>

      <p>In the Big Horn Basin there has been numerous coal veins uncovered; but so far as I am aware the coals are not first class.  On the other hand there is no reason why good coal should not be found.  I enclose you such analysis as I have.  I have other samples that I have not had time to work with.</p>

      <p>Semi-anthracite has been found in local broken down veins near <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Buffalo​ ">Bufalo</a>
    ​; but it has no commercial importance.  I know of a region in Central Wyo. where there is every reason for believing that there is <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="anthracite​ ">antracite</a>
    ​, and should the Burlington build as per their new preliminary they will pass near it.  I also know of many localities where there are coal fields that are well worth looking up — especially near the new Burlington survey.  The way matters stand at present there has never been such opportunities for people to make good investments as at present.  The coal lands I refer to are on the public domain and subject to be located by any citizen under regulation of the law.</p>

      <p>The nearest coal to Hartville is the lignite beds of the Platte which outcrop at Douglas and to the north and east.  There is a chance that these may be converted into fuel fit to reduce iron ore.  If I can be of any service to you, call upon me.  I am the first geologist turned out by the U. of N. and have made Wyoming geology my hobby.  Dr. Barbour can tell you something of me; also Prof. Nicholson.  I send you with this my Bulletin 14 which may give you some very general information.</p>
