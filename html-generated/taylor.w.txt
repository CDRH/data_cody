      <div class="note">William Levi “Buck” Taylor (1857-1924) was billed as the “King of the Cowboys” in Buffalo Bill’s Wild West. Among the original members of the Wild West cast, Taylor had worked for Cody as a ranch hand in Nebraska and later toured with Cody’s stage company, The Buffalo Bill Combination, before the exhibition's formation in 1884. Six-foot-five-inches tall, Taylor was featured for his horsemanship skills.</div>
