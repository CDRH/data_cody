      <p>In reply to your letter about Millis &amp; Co<a href="../doc/n03" class="internal_link">3</a> and others from Red Lodge<a href="../doc/n04" class="internal_link">4</a>. I sent <span class="persName">Alger</span> on the 16<u>th</u> Sep- $5.000 asking him to pay all Red Lodge debts<a href="../doc/n04" class="internal_link">4</a>- since then I have telegraphed him three times and asked him to answer at my expense if he had paid them— Not a word can I get out of him. If our Co gets into trouble it will be Algers neglect— for he has never called on me for money and failed to get it—</p>
