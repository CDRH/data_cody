    ​ ready— and my money is ready— go right a head— have no fear about the money part. I sent a letter to the Cody City Council. Wish you would hurry it up— I have got to build a sewer for the hotel— and have no time to <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="lose​ ">loose</a>
    ​— No one more than your self knows the <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="benefit​ ">benifit</a>
