                <h3>Roughriders of 1898 Gather</h3>
                <h3>Veterans of War in Cuba Celebrate Anniversary of Victory in
                    Battle</h3>
                <div class=" ">
                    <p>There's plenty of life in Teddy Roosevelt's famous Roughriders who, 43 years
                        ago yesterday, routed the Spaniards at the Battle of Las Guasimas, Cuba.</p>

                    <p>Surviving members of the Roughriders, meeting at the Clark in memory of their
                        departed comrades, showed their spirit during discussion of a proposal to
                        change the Roosevelt Roughriders Association to the "Last Man's Club."</p>

                    <h4>TOO YOUNG FOR THAT</h4>

                    <p>"Hell!" exclaimed fiery little Billy McGinty, who as a member of Troop K of
                        the First Volunteer Cavalry (later labeled Roosevelt's Roughriders)
                        participated in the battle, "let's leave that 'last man' stuff to the
                        G.A.R.</p>

                    <p>And that's how it was decided in a meeting conducted by Col. Roger Fitch,
                        commander at Ft. Ord, who was general chairman.</p>

                    <p>Of the 1233 original members of the First Volunteer Cavalry, only 203 remain
                        alive, James T. Brown, arrangements chairman, reported. Of these, a good
                        many reside in Southern California.</p>

                    <h4>SHOW OLD RECORDS</h4>

                    <p>Veterans of the Cuba campaign in attendance at the convention willingly
                        exhibited yellowed and sometimes tattered military service records,
                        honorable discharges or other mementos of their service to their
                        country.</p>

                    <p>Of keen Interest to the veterans was Burr McIntosh's copy of his picture
                        book, "The Little I Saw of Cuba." Some of the old-timers eagerly pointed out
                        their own images in various pictures McIntosh had made as a photographer for
                        Leslie's Weekly, the once-popular picture magazine.</p>
