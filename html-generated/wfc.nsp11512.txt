      <h3>Natives Arrive.</h3>
      <p>The steamship Augusta Victoria, from Hamburg, landed at the Barge office yesterday 636 steerage passengers. Among them were three who gave their names to the recording clerk as follows: Shunken-Ka-Scar, He-Shunka-Scarkta and Marto-Chenumpta. They were Sioux Indians, who had been in Buffalo Bill's show in Europe, and were returning to their homes at Pine Ridge, Nebraska. The English of their names is White Horse, White Weasel and Bear Pipe. One of the braves, White Weasel, is in poor health, and will not be able to proceed on his journey to Pine Ridge until he has rested here after his sea voyage and work for Buffalo Bill. The native Americans were registered by a clerk who was born in Hungary.</p>
