        <p>This paper examines the relationship between the American Exhibition of 1887 and the Wild
          West London season as cultural exports. I argue that 1887 tour marked the beginning of a
          new phenomenon in transatlantic culture even as the US and Britain were experiencing a
          period of high nationalism. By examining the 1888 version of Cody's autobiography,
          particularly The Wild West in England, I will discuss how the frontier came to be defined
          in both nationalist and transnationalist terms. Cody's autobiography demonstrates the role
          spectacle and ritual play in articulating a sense of national identity. In describing this
          process my papers addresses the following questions: What bearing does the British Wild
          West have on a broader discussion of globalism and exceptionalism? Why was the frontier a
          uniquely relevant site for the expression of national ideals and a cosmopolitan
          sensibility? How did Buffalo Bill's version of the frontier myth revise, complicate, and
          enhance its ideological value? </p>
