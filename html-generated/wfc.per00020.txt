         <strong>THE DOWNFALL OF "BUFFALO BILL"</strong>
      </h3>
                <p>Once in a while we hear of an imitator of the great Scout and Plainsman.  Nearly every one who is able to grow long hair, a goatee and mustache, enters the area and strives for fame and fortune.  Up to now, none have succeeded in attracting even the slightest attention, but <strong>We've Discovered a Character</strong> who is bound to make all the Bill's and Pete's and Ike's and Jake's of the West green with envy.  One who studied Buffalo Bill through his weekly magazine and then scurried westward to get into action.</p>
