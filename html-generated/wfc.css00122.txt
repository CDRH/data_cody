Engineer would appreciate this- And use their influence to get these Gentlemen to take the water out of the river in the Canyon. This is going to be an expensive Canal. And the price of water right will have to be liberal. Say from twelve to twenty dollars per acre. And they will sell for that— I expect to get five thousand Sweeds men women &amp; children in to the Basin inside of two years- I am on

The Shoshone River Canyon is a deep canyon between Rattlesnake Mountain and Cedar Mountain west of Cody, Wyoming. Heart Mountain's summit is about ten miles northwest of Cody. Both the power plant and irrigation system watering the lands around Heart Mountain envisioned by William F. Cody in this letter were eventually built by the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation as part of the Shoshone Project after Cody relinquished his development rights to the government.<a href="#n02.ref"> [back]</a>

Certified as complete by the Wyoming state engineer in 1903, the canal irrigates about 20,000 acres of land near the towns of Byron, Lovell, and Cowley.  William F. Cody and Nate Salsbury had been persuaded to give up a portion of their water rights for the Cody-Salsbury canal in order to leave sufficient flow for the Sidon Canal. Here Cody expresses the belief that if Mormon settlers were to obtain and irrigate more land on the lower Shoshone River, the water rights remaining for Cody and Salsbury to sell to others would not generate enough revenue to finance their own canal project.<a href="#n03.ref"> [back]</a>
