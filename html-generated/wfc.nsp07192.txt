      <h3>Buffalo Bill in England.</h3>

      <p>Buffalo Bill, in going to England, deviated from the usual custom of less illustrious travelers. Instead of putting himself at once into the hands of London's tailor, Poole,<a href="../doc/n01" class="internal_link">1</a> as soon as he arrived, he chose to supply himself with a liberal outfit in America, and he landed on the other side with any amount of "store clothes." One suit, in which he intends to pay his respects to the <span class="persName">queen</span>, is of dark gray; another, in which he will appear at the queen's jubilee as Nebraska's representative, is two shades of blue, while a gorgeous hunting costume, which, perhaps, will be seen in Windsor forest, consists of blue corduroy jacket, gray corduroy trousers and scarlet and brown waistcoat.—<em class="hi">New York Sun.</em>
