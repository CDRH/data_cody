The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "St. Louis, Mo. / Sunday, May 17. Arrived in town at 1.30 P.M., a good run considering distance traveled. Everything on the lot at 4.30, and all up before dark. Byrns, the Irish soldier, who left at Cumberland, Md., joined us again to-day and went on duty. Nate Salsbury, manager of the Wild West, came on from Chicago, and met us at the lot to-day. We found the lot large but uneven, with every indication of being bad in wet weather. J. Allen Darnaby tells an amusing story, much to the delight of Messrs. Hutchinson, Showles and Stanton." <a href="#n01.ref"> [back]</a>
