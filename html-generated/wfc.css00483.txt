We do owe thousands in Red Lodge and you never mentioned it. Why did you not tell us in Philadelphia that we owed Millis &amp; Co $2700? God only know how much more that we owe that you <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="don't​ ">dont</a>

this way any longer— its not justice or even friendship. Every thing else at your end as near as I can find out is being run in a loose careless way. there seems to be no head or tail to any thing.</p>

   <div class="note">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in St. Louis, Missouri, May 18-23, 1896; no performance was held on Sunday, May 17. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "St. Louis, Mo. / Sunday, May 17. Arrived in town at 1.30 P.M., a good run considering distance traveled. Everything on the lot at 4.30, and all up before dark. Byrns, the Irish soldier, who left at Cumberland, Md., joined us again to-day and went on duty. Nate Salsbury, manager of the Wild West, came on from Chicago, and met us at the lot to-day. We found the lot large but uneven, with every indication of being bad in wet weather. J. Allen Darnaby tells an amusing story, much to the delight of Messrs. Hutchinson, Showles and Stanton." </div>
