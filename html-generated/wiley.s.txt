      <div class="note">Solon L. Wiley (1840-1926) was born in Vermont and grew up in Greenfield, Massachusetts.  After serving in the Union army during the Civil War, Wiley entered business as a hydraulic engineer and contractor.  In 1876, Wiley moved to Omaha, Nebraska, where he managed companies that provided water service and electric lighting to city residents.  In Wyoming, Wiley's Big Horn Basin Development Company undertook two significant irrigation ventures.  The Bench Canal, begun in the 1890s and completed by 1907, diverted water from the Greybull River to irrigate an area then known as Germania Bench (the name was later changed to Emblem Bench due to anti-German sentiment during World War I).  The town of Germania (now Emblem) in Big Horn County was a result of this successful project. Much less successful were Wiley's attempts to irrigate the area called Oregon Basin with water from the Shoshone River and to found a town (called Wiley) about twelve miles southeast of Cody.  The Big Horn Basin Development Company was unable to complete the necessary canal and went into receivership in 1908.  Solon Wiley lost much of his personal fortune in the process, and left the Basin to return to Omaha.  The town of Wiley soon disappeared.</div>
