Mr. John H. Tait,
Denver, Colo.

<span class="salute">My dear Tait:</span>



      <p>I got into a blizzard coming down from the TE. The car that was to meet me was broken down on the way and I drove half of the distance in one on those light buggies that we have at the TE, and I never was in such a blizzard in all my life. It was simply awful. I almost froze to death. I was chilled and it was a wonder I ever <span class="unclear torn">[stood?]</span> the trip.</p>

      <p>I am getting better, however, but I am still here on my back. I wouldn't say anything to the newspapers about it, that I am ill, but however, such is the case.</p>

      <p>As soon as I am able to travel I am going to Chicago. Perhaps your next letter to me had better be addressed to the LaSalle Hotel.</p>

      <p>I received your two letters and also the assay report on the mines. These last two strikes ought to add very much value to our mines down in Arizona.</p>

      <p>I am not feeling strong enough and I have got so many things to write, so remember me to Bert and all the rest.</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">As ever,</span>

         <br/>Governor,<br/>
T.
