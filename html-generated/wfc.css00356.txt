C. E. Perkins, Esq.,
Burlington, Iowa.

          <span class="salute">Dear Sir:</span>
        

        <p>I am informed by H. C. Alger, of Sheridan, Treasurer of our Company, that you have
          inquired of him if we will give you the right of way of the segregated lands of the
          Shoshone Irrigation Company; and give you land enough for your local purposes on our town
          site of Cody. I hasten to assure you that we will do so with pleasure. Further than this,
          I will also guarantee that you shall have the right of way over the lands segregated to
          Mr. Salsbury and myself on the north side of the Shoshone River, which are subject to our
          ownership of the water rights of the Cody and Salsbury Canal. You may be sure of the
          hearty co-operation of all concerned to further the interests of the Burlington in the Big
          Horn Basin. You will understand that the north side canal is a very large affair for two
          men to handle and it may be possible that we will invite outside capital to assist our
          plans. In case we do this, can I assure investors that the Burlington will extend its line
          to Cody at a date in the near future? You can readily see that such assurance will be of
          great value to us, if we desire to negotiate co-operative capital.</p>

        <span class="closer">
          <span class="salute">Very truly yours,</span>
          <br/>(Sgd.) W. F. Cody.
        </span>

        
          <p>P. S. I let the Mormons have eleven thousand acres of farming land and now they want
            another tract of twenty-nine thousand acres on the Shoshone river below McCullough Peak.
            We are receiving hundreds of letters enquiring [sic] about the country, and are getting
            many new settlers this spring.</p>
