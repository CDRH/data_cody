      <h3>NATE SALSBURY'S WELCOME.</h3>

      <h3>A DINNER TO THE PARTNER OF THE TYPICAL AMERICAN.</h3>

      <p>Genial <span class="persName">Nate Salsbury</span>, bearded and bronzed after his European trip with Buffalo Bill Cody and the Wild West Show, was welcomed home last evening at a dinner at Delmonico's, at which Anarchical Steele Mackaye<a href="../doc/n01" class="internal_link">1</a> presided. The welcome home was because he and his partner had carried the Stars and Stripes successfully through the snug and tight little island 2,500 miles away, and shown to the English people that some good might come out of Nazareth. That he had come back with his pockets lined with gold made every one feel happy, and the bottled-up enthusiastic Americanism of such men as Larry Jerome<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> and Tom Ochiltree<a href="../doc/n03" class="internal_link">3</a> oozed out in great big chunks in commendation of the enterprise which took them across the water. Nate Salsbury was particularly happy when he told how cordially he had been received by the Britishers, but when he undertook to tell how much he thought of the British cousins he met over there his efforts paled into insignificance, because Osmond Tearle,<a href="../doc/n04" class="internal_link">4</a> with the frank speech of a Briton who loves America, told how he and his partner deserved all the success they met with over on the other side. "It was the welcome of a mother to her children," said Mr. Tearle, "and God knows you deserve it, for America has opened heart and arms and hands and pockets to us Englishmen who have come over to try and amuse you on the stage."</p>

      <p>And Dr. T. S. Robertson,<a href="../doc/n05" class="internal_link">5</a> the Scotch-American doctor whom every actor loves, and big John Schoeffel,<a href="../doc/n06" class="internal_link">6</a> and eye-glassed Frank Sanger,<a href="../doc/n07" class="internal_link">7</a> and blonde-mustached Clay Greene,<a href="../doc/n08" class="internal_link">8</a> the dramatist; bluff Edward L. Merrifield,<a href="../doc/n09" class="internal_link">9</a> quiet David Yuengling,<a href="../doc/n10" class="internal_link">10</a> jolly Capt. "Billy" Conner,<a href="../doc/n11" class="internal_link">11</a> who had a touching and thoroughly pat word to say in memory of the great John McCullough;<a href="../doc/n12" class="internal_link">12</a> blonde Harrison Gray Fiske,<a href="../doc/n13" class="internal_link">13</a> bluff John W. Keller,<a href="../doc/n14" class="internal_link">14</a> suave George Floyd,<a href="../doc/n15" class="internal_link">15</a> and quiet Dr. J. F. Traut<a href="../doc/n16" class="internal_link">16</a> couldn't help joining with the unique Marshall Wilder<a href="../doc/n17" class="internal_link">17</a> in drinking the health to the Queen, after Salsbury's gracious recognition of her and her appreciation of a show that was so uniquely and entirely American as that which Salsbury helped introduce to the Englishmen. There were columns of good things said about Salsbury and Buffalo Bill during the evening, and every one was glad to join in welcoming back to America an American actor with English guineas in his pocket, who had insisted that wherever he went the American flag must fly. It was because he came back more distinctively American than he ever was before, if possible, that his welcome was so warm hearted and so thoroughly American.</p>
