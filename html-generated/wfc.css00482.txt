   <div class="note">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Louisville, Kentucky, May 13-14, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "Louisville, Ky. / Wednesday, May 13. Arrived in town at 4.30 A. M. Had a two-mile haul to lot. We put up every yard of canvas and every seat we had. Cowboy Ed Goodrich was thrown in the bucking act and secured three ugly scalp wounds. J. T. McCaddon returned this morning from Chicago. Our new buffalo calf commenced his show career to-day and went around the arena with its mother in the buffalo hunt, making quite a hit. J. G. Elgin, of B. &amp; O. S. W. R. R., and Dr. H. Ray Cannon were guests of Fred Hutchinson. / Business in the afternoon good, in the evening big."</div>

   <div class="note">Note 4: "Red Bluffs" refers to a hill formation to the south and west of Cody, Wyoming, that stands out among the other mountainous formations due to its red color.</div>
