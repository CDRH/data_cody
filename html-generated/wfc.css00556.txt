         <span class="persName">Lillie</span> and I now own everything. 70 rail road cars. 170 big draft horses. Elephants <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="camels​ ">cammels</a>
    ​ in fact the Entire outfit valued at $300,000 of course it will take me a few weeks to pay some money I had to borrow. but six weeks good biz and I am clear. we will take $60,000 here this week. Lillie is a close conservative manager <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="always​ ">allways</a>
    ​ on the job. And it <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="won't​ ">wont</a>
    ​ be long now until I am on easy avenue again.</p>

      <p>The last few years have been hard ones for me but I never weakened— and my good friends have stood by me. And I <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="won't​ ">wont</a>
