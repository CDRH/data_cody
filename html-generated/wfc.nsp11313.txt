                    <p>Chaplin in a two-reel rib rubber, entitled "Charlie's Nightmare," tonight and tomorrow night. Also Blanche Sweet in "The Evil Eye." This thrilling story by Hector Trumbull was founded upon an occurrence in one of the vineyards in California's famous wine-producing country. A lady doctor was sent to the Mexican settlement to examine the throats of her patients, who were afflicted with diptheria. She wore one of the familiar electric lamps on her forehead. The superstitious Mexicans promptly decided that it was "the Evil Eye" and planned to capture the woman and burn our her eyes. See how this plan is frustrated tonight at the Rex.</p>
