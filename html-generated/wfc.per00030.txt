         <strong>"Life of Buffalo Bill" Cleaning Up</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>According to reports received from the Buffalo Bill and Pawnee Bill Film Company, the "Life of Buffalo Bill" has re-awakened great interest in western productions of a historical nature.  One of the state right buyers, Joseph Gondos, who has bought three states so far, writes that he is playing to record-breaking houses.  The picture seems to appeal chiefly to school children.  In several towns where Mr. Gondos has shown, the principals and teachers of the schools have arranged for the children to see the "Life of Buffalo Bill" after school hours.  Mr. Gondos made a special arrangement with several lecturers of the different towns, and in that way introduced the life of the scout to the children.  Reports from California and eastern territory seem to verify the statements of the popularity of the life of the scout.  In the city of Boston the same tactics were pursued.  School children were permitted to see the pictures and to hear a lecture on the life of Buffalo Bill, with the result that in the evening the theaters were jammed.</p>
