      <p>BIRTH AT THE WILD WEST CAMP.—Yesterday, in the Indian camp at the Wild West Show, the squaw of <span class="persName">Little Chief</span>, (who ranks next to <span class="persName">Red Shirt</span>) gave birth in the morning to a female child. This is the first birth which has taken place during the sojourn of the Indians in this country. A council was held in camp during the day, and the name quickly decided upon—Frances Victoria Alexandra—in honour of Mrs. Cleveland,<a href="../doc/n01" class="internal_link">1</a> 
         <span class="persName">Queen Victoria</span>, and the Princess of Wales.<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> The Indians celebrated the event with the rejoicings usual on such an occasion, and <span class="persName">Major Burke</span> telegraphed the news to Red Cloud, the great chief of the Sioux Indians at Pine Ridge Agency. A child of Little Chief died last summer in London, and was buried at West Brompton Cemetery. The papoose and mother are doing well.</p>
