         <a href="#n02.note" class="ref">2</a> :</span>




      <p>I have the honor to enclose herewith a letter, addressed to the Secretary of War<a name="n03.ref"> </a>
         <a href="#n03.note" class="ref">3</a> by Colonel W. F. Cody, (Buffalo Bill), dated August 24th, 1913.</p>
      <p>The Colonel is very much interested in carrying out the plan proposed in his letter and presented the matter to the Secretary of War, who, I understand, is favorably impressed with the idea. Personally, I think it is a good thing, as the characters referred to are most of them old men, and this is about the last chance we will have to get a reproduction of what took place at Pine Ridge.</p>
