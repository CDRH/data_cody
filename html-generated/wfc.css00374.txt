Mr. G. W. Holdrege,
Gen'l Manager, Omaha.

<span class="salute">Dear Sir:</span>

      <p>In view of the complications about land titles at and near Cody City, what do you think of the expediency of staying on the north side of the river, opposite there, if we can arrange it so as to satisfy the old proprietors of the town of Cody?  I say satisfy them, because we told them definitely that we were going to build to Cody, and they may have invested money, or gone to expense, which would give them a claim upon us.  It seems to me this is a good deal of a question, and perhaps we ought to talk about it?</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours truly,</span>
         <br/>C. E. Perkins
