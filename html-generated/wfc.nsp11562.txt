      <h6 class="fw">THE UMPIRE</h6>
      <h6 class="fw">SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1888.</h6>

      <p>Tremendous jubilation agitated the Wild West camp at Salford, on Ash Wednesday. There was no performance, owing to a wise and beneficent law passed by the illustrious senators of Salford. So they had "a day off." This day they devoted to the christening of the Indian baby.</p>

      <p>The ceremony took place at St. Clement's Church, and a crowd of spectators assembled, all the notabilities of the Show being well to the fore.</p>

      <p>It would have brought tears of joy to a Wild Western editor's eyes to have heard <span class="persName">Broncho Bill</span>—of the Smith and Western persuasion—making the responses for <span class="persName">Little Chief</span>. But the nicest thing of all was to see <span class="persName">Major Burke</span> assisting to take the collection. There are few things the genial Major has not taken in his career, from scalps downwards, but this is the first occasion, I should imagine, on which he has ever assisted in a "show" of this kind.</p>
