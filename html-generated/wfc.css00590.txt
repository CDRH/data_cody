To Sells <a href="../doc/n01" class="internal_link">1</a>
Commissioner of Indian Affairs
Washington, D. C.




  <p>Have just sent following telegram to Brennan<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> at Pine Ridge and desire your report also on same by wire here  quote Colonel Cody desires within the next month to have a duplication for moving picture purposes of the last surrender of the Indians in your neighborhood <del>and</del> with General Miles and other living Army officers participating, and at the same time have pictures of the children in school, working and on the farm and otherwise industrially engaged, the whole presenting an historical event of the progress of the Indians for the last twenty years. I have told him that I saw no reason to object to this being done provided it meets with your approval and can be done in such a way as not to demoralize the Indians themselves. He says that he will care for the Indians and that some time will be necessary to train them for their part in this pagent, perhaps two weeks in. Do you see any reason</p>
