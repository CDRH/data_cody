    ​ the money to go on this winter &amp; that Carey Act is so uncertain. <span class="persName">Salsbury</span> writes me no business man will now touch it. Now old Pard I will do all I can to keep you <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Solid​ ">Sollid</a>
    ​. But you must let me down just as easy &amp; quietly as possible. You can tell them its to expensive to try to work in winter— that work will be resumed in the Spring. <span class="persName">Van Dreveldt</span> ought to be through— So he can be let off. Is <span class="persName">Heckert</span> going to stay there. I would certainly not pay him if he does not stay &amp; work. If you think best We can keep my teams at work all winter— Heck said he could do that whole job with our own outfit in 60 days— Your last estimate <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="don't​ ">dont</a>
