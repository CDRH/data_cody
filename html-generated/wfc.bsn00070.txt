Mr. George Bleistein,

Currier Co.,

Buffalo, N. Y.


<span class="salute">Dear Mr. Bleistein:</span>


      <p>I received <span class="persName">Mr. Gerrans</span>" message that you were drawing for $2500.00. I was very sorry that at the time it was almost impossible for me to take care of the whole amount and wired him to that effect, and upon his advice I drew a draft on you for $1500.00, being the amount which we were unable to take care of at that time.</p>

      <p>I have your message of the 13th asking us to take care of the $1500.00 draft temporarily. It has not been returned yet, but we will take care of it in some way. Money seems rather tight; in fact is quite close with us, but I assure you we are glad to strain a point to the utmost to accommodate any of you. It would make some difference, as you know, if we could have some idea as to about when you might return the $2500.00, or a part of it. I do not want you to think that in writing you in this way we are urging you to return it, as we could get along without it; but up to the past month we have been discouting bills and really going along nicely, but recently have had to suspend discounting bills.</p>

      <p>With kind regards and hoping you are getting along nicely, I remain,</p>


      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Very truly yours,</span>
      </span>
