   <div class="note">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Baltimore, Maryland, September 30-October 1, 1895; there was no performance on Sunday, September 29, 1895.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: Sulphur Creek is a natural streambed located west of Cody, Wyoming, flowing north toward the Shoshone River along the south side of Cedar Mountain.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 3: Daniel O'Day (c.1846-1906) was the vice-president of the National Transit Company and one of the five principals of Standard Oil Company. O'Day's greatest achievement may have been engineering the transfer of the oil-carrying trade from the Empire Transportation Company to the Erie Railroad. O'Day was instrumental in laying the first oil pipeline in the state of New York in 1873, building the first pipelines from the oilfields to New York City. O'Day acted as president and/or director of many budding banks and oil-related companies. Mr. O'Day was a close personal friend of John D. Rockefeller and George Bleistein.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 4: Cody asks about naming "streets" or "tracts" after both Union and Confederate Generals. In a previous letter dated September 25, 1895, Cody also refers to naming streets in the first planned town site, and the initial plats of the town of Cody in that original location show the streets named for generals. In the town site's later and current location, the main street of Sheridan Avenue, named for General Philip Sheridan, is the only street honoring a general; the principal east-west streets were and still are named for founders of the town.</div>

   <div class="note">Nope 5: "Nailor" is likely Colonel Allison Nailor, Jr. (1836-1908), from Washington, D.C., who was a friend of Cody's and with him on Cody's trip to the Grand Canyon in 1892. Nailor and others were expected to join Cody on the hunt that he was planning for December 1895.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 6: "Prest Perkins" would likely have been Charles Elliott Perkins (1840-1907), then president of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy.  His son is referred to as "Young Perkins Son." In Cody's time, the term "president" was often written as "prest."</div>

   <div class="note">Note 7: Henry Guy Carleton (1813-1901), the oldest son of Major General James H. Carleton, became a noted American humorist, journalist, author, playwright, and an amateur inventor of the 19th century. </div>

   <div class="note">Note 8: The hunt Cody was planning for December that year.</div>
