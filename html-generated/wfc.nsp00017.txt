      <h3>A Buffalo Bill Indian Dead.</h3>
   
      <p>Man-Afraid-of-Hawk, aged twenty-one, a full-blooded Sioux Indian connected with the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show, died at the Danbury Hospital to-night after a brief illness from inflammation of the stomach. Eagle Bear, another member of the show, is also in a critical condition. A number of other attaches were ill upon their arrival here this morning, but with the exception of the two Indians none of the cases is of a serious nature.  It is believed the men were made sick through eating canned corn.</p>
