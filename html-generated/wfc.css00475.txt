   <div class="note">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Clarksburg, West Virginia, on April 28, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "Clarksburg, W. Va. / Tuesday, April 28. Arrived in town at 9.15. We were late in getting up. Doors did not open until 2.15 P. M. Johnny Franz, Cowboy rider, was thrown during the afternoon performance and had his right arm broken above the wrist. / Lot, Jackson lot under Pinnecineck Hill. / Arena, 182 x 322. / Business, in the afternoon good, in the evening fair."</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: The year is not inscribed by Cody but is 1896 as determined by the Routes List.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 3: "Sulphur Creek" is a natural streambed located west of Cody, Wyoming, flowing north toward the Shoshone River along the base of Cedar Mountain.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 4: "The Management is ceartainly Bad" is Cody's reference to funds for the irrigation project being badly managed and money quickly dwindling.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 5: "Flood" is likely D. P. Flood whose role in the irrigation project is not known.</div>
