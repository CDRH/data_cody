   <div class="note">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed daily (except Sunday) in Boston from June 10 through June 22, 1895.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: Cody and Beck were hoping to persuade Omaha businessman William A. Paxton to join their planned irrigation venture, which would eventually result in the construction of the Cody Canal and the founding of the town of Cody, Wyoming.  Ultimately, Paxton decided not to invest in the Cody Canal.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 3: Cody refers to Horace C. Alger, who was George Beck's original partner in the venture that eventually became the Shoshone Irrigation Company.  As a Harvard alumnus and a native of Massachusetts, Alger was an obvious choice to assist Cody in seeking investors in New England.</div>
