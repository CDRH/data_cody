      <span class="salute">Dear <span class="persName">Beck</span>

      <p>Yours 15<u>th</u> I do hope you will push the work and get the water down. You should have commenced sooner. I told you I would send the 1000- did I ever fail yet. When we get a rail road which will be in side of three years— and our town numbers thousands and land worth $100 an acre— then I wont have such hard work getting my colleagues to put up— The B.M.<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> will build to us sure—</p>

      <p>Our settlers should plant every acre possible. They will get their own prices next winter. Now is the time to farm before the rail road gets there—</p>

      <p>Write me fully. When will you have water in Cody?</p>
