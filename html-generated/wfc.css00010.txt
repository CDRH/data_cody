<span class="salute">My Dear Major,</span>



      <p>The Indians with me want a favor. And as they have been such good men I hope you will grant it.</p>

      <p>They have been saving and bought a great many useful things to take home. But they are shy a <span class="unclear ">[bunch?]</span> and it breaks an Indians heart to go home without a trunk.</p>

      <p>They would like to have $10 each the $25 a month men. The Chiefs $15 each. This to be taken from their last month and back pay that is to be paid them in your presence.</p>

      <p>Hope you will grant their request.</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Very faithfully yours</span>
         <br/>W. F. Cody
