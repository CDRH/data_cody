   <div class="note">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in South Bend, Indiana, on August 14, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "South Bend, Ind. / Friday, August 14. Arrived in town at 4.30 A. M. One-half mile haul to lot. The lot was in fine condition in the forenoon and looked good. At 4 P. M. a heavy rain came up that lasted two hours, and at the end of that time the lot was ready to join our long list of bad lots. More horses fell during the evening performance than at any other performance this season. August Beree and Herman Montery, French soldiers, received bad falls during the evening performance by their horses stepping into holes. Chief Loucas, of the Cossacks, had a bad fall to-night which resulted in the death of his horse, a beautiful animal and a black eye to the chief. He had run into one of the bad places in the arena, and as he fell his horse's neck was broken. They carried the chief out, but as soon as he was in the dressing-room he came to and was all right, with the exception of a few bruises. The chief mourns over the loss of his horse, for during the four years he has been with the Wild West, he and his horse have been inseparable. We had a long pull and long haul to-night. / Business fair. / Lot, Arnold and Division streets. / Arena 180 x 344."</div>
