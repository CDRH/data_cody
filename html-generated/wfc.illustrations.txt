      <field name="text">The following text accompanies this illustration: Buffalo Bill and Co. will be agreeable additions to London society, as well as a big attraction in the show way. We have had lots of our American cousins, more or less polished, but the real rough diamonds have been reserved till now. Let us hope nothing may happen to ruffle their equanimity. The idea of a horde of untamed savages running amuck down Fleet Street and the Strand tomahawking and scalping harmless newspaper men makes one nervous. Talking of tomahawks, by-the-way, it might not be such a bad notion for some one to revive the title of that sprightly journal once conducted by Messrs. Arthur A'Beckett and Matt Morgan, as an organ for the Buffalo band.

Accompanying text: THE SHOWMAN. Ladies and Gentlemen,—
 "Oh, what a surprise!" That, in songful parlance, will be the general exclamation on Monday next, I guess, when visitors first enter the American Exhibition, and behold Fenimore Cooper's "Last of the Mohicans" realized by "Buffalo Bill's" "Wild West" Show at Earl's Court. "Hail, Columbia," and wave the Star-spangled Banner—for "Yankee Doodle's come to town" with an "onparalleled show," and no mistake. 'Tis unique. 'Pon my word, I was fairly staggered at the vast extent of ground transformed by hundreds of busy bees—directed by King Bee John Robinson Whitley—into an industrial Palace of noble proportions, into Pleasure Gardens where toboganning and whirls on the Switchback Railway will soon be the fashion, and into an Indian Encampment vivid and real as the Indian Fights in the arena. I'm sure the American Exhibition will prove the greatest eye-opener in London this Jubilee Season. 
 We gladly offer the hand of cordial friendship to our brethren from across the Atlantic, for we in this Show have ever honestly striven, in storm and in sunshine, to cement the natural alliance that ought to exist between Britain and the United States. Blood is thicker than water. We are kith and kin. Let us foregather, and become firmer friends yet, at the American Exhibition!
 I own up at once. Candidly, when it was my privilege the other day to stroll among the white tents of the Red Indians and the Texan Cowboys—to see Uncas himself, as it seemed, emerge from his hermetically guarded canvas home, and march by with all the native dignity of his race—to watch a droll little Indian chap being chased and lassoed in fun by a juvenile cow-boy—to interview towering "Buck Taylor" in his snug tent—to hear the praises of the Honourable William F. Cody, "Buffalo Bill" himself, sung by his quiet, masterful General Manager, Major John M. Burke—and then had the good fortune to witness the dashing, fearless, free-and-easy, reckless charges of painted Indians and stalwart "Cowboys" in full rehearsal round the track—why, I had to rub my eyes to find whether I wasn't dreaming. Here was the living, breathing "Wild West" actually before one. Here was the noble Indian who proved as unmoved in the presence of our Grand Old White Chief as Lord Randolph Churchill himself does. Acknowledged Chief of all finally came the here, "Buffalo Bill"—the living embodiment of Fenimore Cooper's "Pathfinder," "Deerslayer," Hawkeye in "The Last of the Mohicans," and the trapper (wasn't he?) in "The Prairie"; and the counterfeit presentment of many a gallant American in the thrilling romances of my old friend Captain Mayne Reid, whose remains I followed to their last resting-place not many miles from here—in Kensal Green. Ah, whose turn next, and next? But away with melancholy! Let's be jolly at the American Exhibition! Success to the plucky American entrepreneurs. Their grand Show is bound to draw "all London"—ay, and thousands from the provinces—to Earl's Court ..... CODLIN.

Caption reads: "Red Shirt," Chief of the Seeyou-at-West-Kensington Indians, receives a
visit from "Grand Old White Collar," alias "Strong Will," Chief of the Opper Sishun Hinderuns. Accompanying text reads:
CHIEFS IN COUNCIL.
From Our Own Special Earl's Court Interpreter.
  THE Distinguished Statesman and party had now arrive at the encampment, and it was explained to the illustrious Indian hero that the Great White Chief" was waiting to receive him without. In another instant "Yellow Slippers," ferocious in his war-paint and feathers, had sprung to the door of his tent with a wild war-whoop, and, brandishing his gleaming tomahawk, signified, in the stinging accents of the Sioux dialect, his readiness to meet all comers. There was some commotion among those assembled outside, but it quickly subsided on the Trapper announcing, at the Distinguished Statesman's request, that the "'Great White Father' had only come to have a little friendly talk over the peace pipe." Upon hearing this, the Indian, eyeing his supposed rival disdainfully, drew his blanket moodily around him, and waited for the conversation to commence.
  "I had better put a poser to him, to open with," observed the Distinguished Statesman, thoughtfully. "Ask him what, in his opinion, will be the probable effects of the forthcoming Show on the financial prospects of the General Omnibus Company, and the Metropolitan District Railway respectively, and how he thinks the Shareholders of either undertaking will view the progress of the projected enterprise."
  On this being translated to the "Yellow Slippers," he only glared fiercely for a few minutes in the direction of the "Great White Father," and then shook his head.
  "He does not understand," explained the Trapper.
  "Dear me, that's awkward," rejoined the Distinguished Statesman, "for, wishing to impress him, I had arranged several complicated questions for his solution. Ha! but I have them hinted at here in the notes for my luncheon speech Suppose you just read him this, I fancy it mayn't be very clear, for I haven't quite made up my own mind what it all means, and so, no doubt, it will probably puzzle him."
  He handed a well-penciled sheet of paper to the Trapper as he spoke. The latter proceeded forthwith to translate its contents to "Yellow Slippers," who, however, repeatedly shook his head at the various points, and gradually assumed an attitude of threatening defiance. Finally, on its conclusion, he instantly sprang to his feet, and again giving a wild war-whoop, expressed his desire to have done with palaver, and meet the "Great White Father" in combat in the arena, either with tomahawk or lasso, and there discuss with him, in a language he could understand, matters rather more within his ordinary comprehension.
  Affairs assuming, therefore, a rather threatening aspect, and "Yellow Slippers" being understood still to express a wish that instead of meeting the "Great White Father," surrounded by pale faces, at West Kensington, he could only come across him alone on the deserted plains of the real Wild West, the Distinguished Statesman and party hastily withdrew, and retired to another part of the extensive grounds under the guidance of the courteous officials who accompanied them.

      <field name="text">The Great White Chief. On the occasion of Mr. Gladstone's visit to the American Exhibition, Red Shirt, the Sioux Chief, was introduced to the ex-Premier, it being explained to him that the latter was the "Great White Chief" of this country.—Vide Public Press.
Six frames with captions as follows:
  Frame, upper left: Caption: On the dinner-bell ringing that evening, Mr. Gladstone came down with the fringe from the bed-hangings nearly sewn down the seams of his t*o*s*rs. 'Gracious! Willie, dear, what means this?" cried Mrs. Gladstone. "The correct thing, my darling," explained the Great White Chief.
  Frame, upper center: Caption: But in the dead of night Mrs. Gladstone, finding it rather chilly, discovered one of the blankets missing from the bed, and on making further search, Mr. W. E. G. also. He was subsequently found in the grounds tracking a stray cat by the light of the moon.
  Frame, upper right: Caption: The first thing next morning he took train to town, and call at Fox's. Said he to Mrs. F., "Do you sell war-paint?" "How much do you require?" asked Mrs. F. "Half a pint will be enough," said he. "We sell it in sticks," said Mrs. F.: "any wigs?" "Capital idea!? he cried; "yes, I'll take a Sioux Indian's please."
  Frame, lower left: Caption: The Great White Chief returned home, and soon issued forth in his war-paint. "Ugh, ugh? who are you?" said he to one of his farm menials. "Please, sur, I be one of your cowboys," replied the youth, smiling. "Then henceforth you will wear a grey shirt, slouch hat, and mocassins," cried the Chief.
  Frame, lower center: Caption: While at the Exhibition, the Great White Chief saw Buck Taylor, the cow-boy king, pick up small articles off the ground while riding at full gallop. "Ill try if I can't do the same," said the Chief, casting his toothpick on the sward. He tried, and couldn't.
  Frame, lower right: Caption: We understand that the Great White Chief lives in the hopes of eventually taking the scalps of the rival chiefs of the Commons and of Mr. Swinburne. He has constructed a wigwam at his Hawarden home, to which Fenians and photographers are always welcome.

A Derby Day Romance, and what came of it.

"Ups" and "Downs" I have had, as we all of us have—
For with smiles Fortune mingles her frowns—
But the "ups" are not half so delightful to me
As at Epsom are sometimes the downs.

Said I to a damsel I met on those downs,
"You're a lady I'd like much to own;
It is Darby Day now, and your Darby I'll be,
If to me you will be a good Joan."

"That I will!" she exclaimed, as she smiled in my face—
Oh, she looked most bewitchingly smart—
She was dressed like a jockey, and soon I perceived
She had jockeyed me out of my heart.

Next day we were married by Registrar Jones,
 But in wedlock not long did we journey,
For before the sweet honeymoon season was past
 She eloped with a country attorney.

I put on my hat when I heard of the fact,
 For a hansom I called. In a trice I
Had her up before Hannen; and now we are freed 
 By the rule that is known as the nisi.

We danced with delight when we found we were free,
 And she gave me a kiss before starting;
Only one thing on earth was more joyous to see
 Than our meeting, and that was—our parting.

Accompanying text: THE WILD WEST—FORMING IN LINE.
 One of the most stirring items in Buffalo Bill's programme in his Wild West Show at the American Exhibition, is the entry into the arena of the various members of the company, as one by one they dash out of their rocky fastnesses and ride wildly round the arena to what may be called the saluting point in front of the chief seats—when they rein suddenly in, and after saluting the spectators join their comrades and form a long thin line. A singular picturesque sight is afforded by this row of cowboys, vaqueros, and Indians all in their peculiar attire, particularly when, as in our sketch, the Sioux chief, Red Shirt, rides up, being received with shrill whoops by his comrades, prior to the arrival on the scene of Buffalo Bill himself. A color version of this image ran in The Illustrated Foreign News on June 18, 1887 (see wfc.crt00019).</field>

There was once a Noble Savage - who was invited to a Swell Dinner.
He went literally in his War Paint.
When he had eaten? quite as much as was good for him ...
He thought he would try a little Custard.
He had mistaken the sound of the Word. It was Mustard!!!!
He has now returned to the simple habits of his Fathers.

THE SHOWMAN.
Ladies and Gentlemen,--
 Say! Have yew seen the American Exhibition--Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show! "To the West, to the West, to the Land of the Free, where Bison is mastered by Buffalo B.?" That's the song of the season. John Bull and Brother Jonathan shake hands cordially at Earl's Court. We all wish Godspeed to the American Exhibition--Substantial token of the hearty friendship and close relationship existing between Britain and the United States--bright forerunner of the warm alliance which is, by-and-by, to unite all English-speaking Peoples all the world over in a kindred Confederation, one in mind, whether the Union Jack or the Star-spangled Banner be our flag of glory!
 With which peroration from my stock Fourth of July oration, I beg to unfold our panorama of what Prince Bonhomme and Princess Sweeteyes, with their charmingly modest daughters, and the Lornes and the Comtesse de Paris and the rest, saw in the Earl's Court arena on the Fifth of May. I chanced to be strolling round the show at the time. So it came about that I was a privileged spectator also of Buffalo Bill's first complete performance in London. My goodness, didn't one and all, Prince or plebeian, relish this novel and stirring Indian Show!
 Behold, in the first place, Buffalo Bill himself in knightly fashion saluting our Prince and Princess. Save in the matter of teasing and goading bulls--at which we most of us winced--the Hon. Bill Cody was apparently quite a Bayard. He lightly yet firmly sat his little horse like a North American Ivanhoe. He sped like lightning over the tan track to give the opening signal. With whirlwind rapidity did the painted and be-feathered. Sioux, Cheyennes, and Arapahoes Indians and bands of Mexican Vaqueros and American Cow-boys then sweep in, the Redskins waking the echoes with their wild war-screams! This rousing display of the wild horsemanship of the prairies is the strangest sight London has seen for many a long day, I assure ye.
 The "Star-Spangled Banner!" The Cow-boy band aptly plays this inspiring air in welcome to Sergeant Bates, which gallant bearer of the Stars and Stripes stirs martial ardour by riding round with the flag of Freedom in hand.
 Marksmanship! Our riflemen score well and quickly, nobody can deny. But, my word, sharp-eyed Annie Oakley and Lilian Smith beat 'em in the general rapidity and certainty with which they demolish earthenware pigeons and glass balls with firearms. Small wonder the Prince and Princess called these lissom young girl shots to the Royal box, and praised them for their skill.
 Ogila-Sa! D'ye twig the Sioux Chief, Ogila-Sa, in full fig yonder? Red Shirt had "got'em all on," and no mistake, and looked proud as a peacock of his crest of eagle's feathers and scarlet blanket, as he marched to the assembly-ground. But he swept round at fine speed, none the less, and was greeted by a chorus of "wirrawirras" when he placed himself at the head of his Sioux troop. Red Shirt then looked every inch a Red King.
 "Buck Taylor!" Surely, horse and man are on when "Buck Taylor," red-shirted King of the Cowboys, is "up." Funny, very, is his battle with his bucking pony, which he rides, however high the wild pony jumps. But I own I preferred to watch his horsemanship when careering after the band of Indians who attack the old ramshackle Deadwood coach. Full of resource, Buck Taylor, notwithstanding his six feet four, flings himself down till his body is wholly hidden by his horse from the Indians. Holding on by his toes in the saddle, he thus avoids the enemy's shots. Rising easily to delivery his own fire, Buck Taylor takes active part in the discomfiture of the Redskins, and in the rescue of the amateur coaching party ballasted by rotund Tom Burnside. A modern Centaur is Buck Taylor. I doff my hat to the King of he Cowboys.
 "Tell him we are immensely pleased at what we have seen!" Depend upon it, Prince Bonhomme's gracious message in this wise to Red Shirt in the Indian Encampment will have a good effect. Fickle as the Prince may sometimes be in the bestowal of Royal favour, he generally has the knack of saying the right thing at the right moment. Characteristically hearty and happy was H.R.H. in expressing to Buffalo Bill his appreciation of the "Wild West." Capped by the graceful and gentlewomanly attention of Princess Sweeteyes to the Redskin little 'uns, the Prince's graciousness might, perchance, have transformed all the Camp into Royalists--were not one and all stanch Republicans of the United States of America.  . . . CODLIN.

THE AMERICAN EXHIBITION. On Saturday evening last the Executive Council of the American Exhibition gave a dinner in the Trophy Room of the Art Gallery to the London Working Men's Association, the attendance being upwards of one hundred. Colonel Russell, a member of the council, presided, and on his left sat Colonel Cody (Buffalo Bill). In proposing the toast of "The Queen" the chairman spoke of the working classes as the vitality of a nation, remarking that he alluded not merely to the work done on the farm on in the workshop, but to the work performed in every rank of life, and said that in America anarchy was crushed when it tried to establish revolution by the prostitution of the dignity of labour. Mr. George Potter proposed "Prosperity to the United States," and in doing so referred to various advantages they possessed over England, and expressed an earnest hope that the peoples of England and America would continue to exhibit good feelings towards each other, and go forward, hand in hand, as the pioneers of liberty, progress, and fraternity. Deputy-Consul Moffatt returned thanks. The remaining toasts included "British Industries," Mr. Jeans, secretary of the Iron and Steel Institute, responding; and "The Chairman and Directors of the American Exhibition," the secretary, Mr. Speed, responding. At the conclusion of the dinner all present accepted an invitation to view the evening performance of the "Wild West" Show in the adjacent arena. </field>
