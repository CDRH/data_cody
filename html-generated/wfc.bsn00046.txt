(40¢) was not made as directed by the Board at the last meeting, because the Ditch was turned over to the Settlers before it was necessary for said levy. That said Canal was turned over in February 1907, and that all salaries ceased then.</p>

      <p>It was moved, seconded and carried, that the President take such steps as may be necessary to dissolve the Corporation, and his action in such respect is hereby ratified.</p>

      <p>On motion, the meeting then adjourned.</p>
