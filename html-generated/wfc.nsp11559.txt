      <p>CHRISTENING AN INDIAN BABY.—Yesterday afternoon an extraordinary scene was witnessed at St. Clement's Church, Salford, when the female child of the Sioux Indian "<span class="persName">Little Chief</span>," which was recently born in Buffalo Bill's camp, was christened in all the rites of the English Church. The entire body of Sioux and Apaché Indians at present located in the Wild West camp walked in procession to the church, which was filled to overflowing with a miscellaneous company, comprising Colonel and Miss Cody,<a href="../doc/" class="internal_link">1</a> 
         <span class="persName">Major Burke</span>, <span class="persName">Buck Taylor</span>, Cowboys, Mexicans, and other spectators. The baptism was performed by the Rev. J. J. Scott, the service being translated sentence by sentence by <span class="persName">Broncho Bill</span>, the Sioux interpreter. After the baptismal rites, the assembled body of Indians sang, "Nearer my God to Thee," in the Sioux tongue. This is the first time in the history of the English Church that American Indians have taken so prominent a part in the service.</p>
