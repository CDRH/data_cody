      <span class="salute">Dear. Major</span>


      <p>When I got to the mines. I made <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="a lot​ ">alot</a>
    ​ of changes. I had suspected for a long time that the Getchells were not <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="toting​ ">toteing</a>
    ​ fair. And I set a trap for them while I was east on my return our attorney had them dead to rights. The first thing was to get in all the outstanding accounts. &amp;c. Col Dyer sent a first class bookkeeper. and to take charge of store &amp;c. Then we sprung the fraudulent transaction on the Getchells. we had service papers ready to <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="serve​ ">surve</a>
    ​ on them. If they refused to make good. The dirty work they had done. was in the purchase of the Southern Bell property. They as our Agents said the property cost so much. when it did not cost over half. they would take our money to pay for property and retain half for them selves. We made them give part of this back and all the stock old man Getchell owned in our Co. Young Getchell had $20.000 worth of Oil Stock he gave that up. Which Col Dyer &amp; I divided

Col Dyer and I now own all the stock of our Mining Co. I then discharged every man the Getchells had brought to the mines. so as to weed them all out. And of course this <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="stopped​ ">stoped</a>
    ​ work at the mines. And we have but three men there now. Nothing open but the store. Then I had to come here. I wanted to take the baths and see our big Standard Oil driller start. <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="It's​ ">Its</a>
    ​ a wonder everything new and the best money and brains could put together. It started off without a hitch and is drilling about four feet an hour. We have but one man on salary <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="that's​ ">thats</a>
    ​ the Driller. the rest all on working for stock in co. I have been out there for three days. I took two Gentlemen with me. who were here at the Springs and they both bought stock. We have raised the price of stock to 25c on the dollar. and next week will raise to 35c. The formation for an oil deposit is perfect. we are putting your name on some of the locations. Should we strike oil our stock will go above par at once. besides we have about ten sections located &amp; recorded I will be here until the 13th then I go back to the mines for a few days. I will be with you early in April. But I fear I <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="can't​ ">cant</a>
    ​ raise any money to help you. But fate seems against me. <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="It's​ ">Its</a>
