      <h3>SUMMARY OF NEWS.</h3>

      <div class="milestone line"> </div>

      <p>THE last weeks are announced of the International Horticultural Exhibition, which has done much to enliven what has in many ways proved a very dull season. Buffalo Bill and his Wild West will take their leave on October 12th, sailing for their native shores three days later by the s.s. <em class="hi">Mohawk</em>, of the Atlantic Transportation Company, a vessel of 8,000 tons, which has been specially chartered for the occasion. As this will be the very last that Europe is likely to see of Colonel Cody and his great show as an organisation (the most original and unique of its kind), it behoves those who want to pay a farewell visit to the Wild West to avail themselves of the opportunity that is still offered of their doing so.</p>
