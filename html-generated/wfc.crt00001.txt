We have had lots of our American cousins, more or less polished, but the real rough diamonds have been reserved till now. Let us hope nothing may happen to ruffle their equanimity. The idea of a horde of untamed savages running amuck down Fleet Street and the Strand tomahawking and scalping harmless newspaper men makes one nervous. Talking of tomahawks, by-the-way, it might not be such a bad notion for some one to revive the title of that sprightly journal once conducted by Messrs. Arthur A'Beckett and Matt Morgan, as an organ for the Buffalo band.
