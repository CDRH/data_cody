                <h3>BIG FILMS FAIL TO MAKE CONNECTION</h3>
                <p>The six-reel Buffalo Bill film for the Root Opera House picture show failed to arrive this afternoon, for some unknown reason, and they are looked for on train No. 19, failing which, Mr. Root has provided a set of pictures to take their place.  They were looked for in time for a matinee this afternoon, but the disappointment was apparent aupon the arrival of train No. 3.  Effort will be made to get the information to the people if the pictures come in time for the night performance.</p>
