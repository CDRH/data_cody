I am sorry you think Mr Martin<a href="../doc/n04" class="internal_link">4</a> was not friendly to you. I told him on his return that he should have consulted you. he located claims in your name— And I cannot make out why he did not work with you— I will send you the $25— to finish half payments on block 7. is the water still coming down to Town<a href="../doc/n05" class="internal_link">5</a> &amp; into the reservoir— do try and get all the water you possibly can in the reservoir<a href="../doc/n06" class="internal_link">6</a>— so we can show people this reservoir this winter— My business big.<a href="../doc/n07" class="internal_link">7</a>
