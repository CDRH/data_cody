<span class="salute">Dear Mr. Rumsey:</span>


      <p>I have yours of the 1st, stating that you had purchased <span class="persName">Mr. Bleistein's</span> stock. I think it is a mighty good deal, as, if we were to close out, it surely would bring more than par.</p>

      <p>I am returning herewith the release which you no doubt want to hand to Mr. Bleistein. I have affixed the corporate seal.</p>
