      <span class="salute">My Dear <span class="persName">Beck</span>
      </span>

      <p>When in Chicago Millis <del>a</del> co<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> was some $2.700. You said you had paid $500 on it. And you had $1,200 co money you said you would pay on it on your return It appears nothing has been paid and the bill is $3.000</p>

      <p>Can you explain this?</p>

      <p>I wrote you that Yegen<a href="../doc/n03" class="internal_link">3</a> says the co owe him $1000 since April &amp; May. this you did not mention in Chicago. Can you in any way list the different amounts the co owes and give them to <span class="persName">Mr. Alger</span> &amp; <span class="persName">Salsbury</span> so I can find out what the co owes— And in some way try and <u>protect</u> 
         <u>our</u> 
         <u>credit</u>.</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours truly</span>

      <p>PS. I write Alger &amp; Salsbury by this mail<del>e</del> to try &amp; get you to do this—</p>

   <div class="note">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Springfield, Ohio, on July 7, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "Springfield, Ohio. / Tuesday, July 7. Arrived in town at 5 A. M. Two-mile haul to lot. If ever Anderson prayed for still weather he did to-day. We could not get a stake down over twelve inches anywhere and the least wind would have blown us down, but with our usual good luck we came out all right. Refreigo Carrello, a Mexican, was thrown in the grand entree to-day; his left shoulder was badly hurt and sprained and he received a lot of small bruises and was badly used up. Master-Mechanic Dan Taylor left to-day for Columbus, Ohio, to get the grounds ready for our next Monday's engagement. / Business at both performances good. / Lot, Columbus and Isabell streets. / Arena, 182 x 368."</div>
