   <div class="note">Note 1: Cody refers to resupplying food ("chuck") for his "outfit" of riders on the ranch.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: Cody most likely refers to the poem "Cody's Corral, or, the Scouts and the Sioux," which was later reprinted in programs for Buffalo Bill's Wild West as early as 1885.  The 1885 program gave credit for the poem to "Buckskin Sam."</div>

   <div class="note">Note 3: In this context, "to fork" means "to mount."  "Pitching" is apparently Texas slang for what other Westerners would call "bucking."</div>
