Weather looks bad for our opening here. Fine cold rain all the morning. We had a long and wet parade to-day. Major J. M. Burke, W. H. Gardner and M. Coyle were seen around the front to-day reviving acquaintances. Mrs. Wm. McCune, wife of Chief Usher Wm. McCune, came from Omaha to-day to spend a few days with "Billie." / Business, fair in the afternoon, big at night."</div>
