      <h3>PRINCE OF MONACO EXPECTS FIRST SHOT AT BEAR AND PROMISES FRIENDS STEAKS FOR SUPPER</h3>
        
        <h3>Royal Huntsman Quits Civilization as He Hits Trail.</h3>
        
        <h3>Young Gates Takes With Him All Comforts of Hotel Life.</h3>
        
        <p>Cody, Wyo, Sept. 29. — Col. W. F. Cody (Buffalo Bill), kept open house at his temporary tepee hotel at Pahaska in honor of his royal guest, the Prince of Monaco, yesterday, the reception being preliminary to the moving of the hunting camps into the wilds tomorrow. The callers included Charles G. Gates ("Spend-a-Million Gates").</p>
        
        <p>Pahaska was the meeting point of two hunting parties, one given by Colonel Cody and A. A. Anderson, the wealthy Cody artist, on whose estate the Prince of Monaco is the guest of honor. The other party is headed by Gates and the party of friends he brought with him from New York last week after reading of the plans made for the big game hunt of Buffalo Bill.</p>
        
        <p>Colonel Cody is director general of both parties, but will continue with Anderson and the Prince of Monaco on one trail, while Gates and his companions, under the guidance of Frost and Richards, two of the most noted guides in this section, enter the heart of the mountains in another direction.</p>
