                <h3> Buffalo Bill's Life Will be Made Into Film</h3>
                <span class="ab">[EXCLUSIVE DISPATCH]</span>
                <p>NEW YORK, June 21. — The life of Buffalo Bill, whose more prosaic name was William F. Cody, will be used for a motion picture.  It was announced today by Maj.-Gen. Hugh L. Scott.  Gen. Scott said that producing such a picture had been proposed first by the late Gen. Nelson A. Miles and that he and Gen. Miles laid the original plans.</p>
                <p>Gen. Scott knew "Buffalo Bill" for years, and he will collaborate in preparing the scenario with Maj. Sherman Miles, a son of Gen. Miles, Maj. H. R. Lemli, Maj.-Gen. E. S. Godfrey and Col. R. Brown.  The picture will be made in sections of the West where Cody gained his fame.</p>
