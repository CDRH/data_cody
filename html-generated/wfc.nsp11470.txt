      <h3>LATEST NEWS FROM THE WILD WEST.</h3>

      <p>Buffalo Bill will have to give out before long. He is expected to be present at every entertainment, public and private. No lady of fashion dreams of giving a ball without having "Buffalo Bill" printed in the corner of the card, and dinner-party invitations are poured upon him by the score.</p>

      <p>"Yes, sir," said he the other day to one of our representatives, "it's rather a trial to my nerves, hard as they are. Just you fancy what my feelings were when a waiter came up to me, and said he, 'Scalped oysters, sir?' Of course he meant 'scalloped'; but I tell you what, I felt inclined to take that oyster—I mean that man—by the beard and—Well, I won’t say any more."</p>

      <p>"And how many balls have you been to, colonel?"</p>

      <p>"Well, sir, I s'pose about ninety-nine have been put up for me since I've been in your country. I could only fire—I mean I could only accept fifty-two, but I hit 'em—that is, I went to 'em all."</p>

      <p>"And did you indulge in a hop?"</p>

      <p>"No, sir. Buck-jumping's more in my line. I fancy," added the gallant colonel, reflectively, "when I get an invite to your Bucking-ham Palace, that I’ll have a try. 'Pears to me there's something in the name that seems familiar."</p>

      <p>"Quite so," acquiesced our R.</p>

      <p>"It's the society, sir, I expect. So mustangy—I beg pardon, so <em class="hi">distangy.</em>"</p>

      <p>"And how do you find this constant round of dissipation act upon your constitution?"</p>

      <p>"Well, sir. It’s not been good for my liver, sir, and that's a fact. Tell you what, I've a good mind to differentiate my name, and call myself Buffalo Bill-ious!"</p>

      <p>After that our R. retired.</p>
