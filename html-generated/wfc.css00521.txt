    ​ recd pay for bridge. I have no idea of what is owed out there. Why <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="don't​ ">dont</a>
    ​ you let some of us know. is it right that the members of our Co are not informed of their obligations. I should think you would be glad to tell them. So you would not be bothered with creditors. So far I have been unable to get any one but <span class="persName">Salsbury</span> to put up— But a wire from <span class="persName">Bleistein</span>

    ​ go to Cuba<a href="../doc/n04" class="internal_link">4</a> until <span class="persName">Miles</span> &amp; the Main Army goes and that will be some time yet. The Scouts I am to Employ are to be Cubans who know the Country</p>

You know what the contract was— I told Bleistein &amp; <span class="persName">Gerrans</span> and they said they would pay Russell. Wish you would see Forbes about it. and get it fixed up— I am quite ill &amp; all these things <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="don't​ ">dont</a>
