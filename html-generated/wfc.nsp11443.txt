      <h3>ROYAL VISIT TO THE "WILD WEST."</h3>

      <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales,<a href="../doc/n01" class="internal_link">1</a> accompanied by the Princess Louise of Wales,<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> the Duke of Cambridge,<a href="../doc/n03" class="internal_link">3</a> the Crown Prince of Denmark,<a href="../doc/n04" class="internal_link">4</a> Duke of Teck,<a href="../doc/n05" class="internal_link">5</a>  and the Marquis of Lorne,<a href="../doc/n06" class="internal_link">6</a> visited the American Exhibition yesterday afternoon, and after having been conducted through the main building the Royal party took up a position on the grand stand to witness a special performance of the Wild West Show. The first part of the programme was a grand processional review, in which the whole of the Indians, cowboys, scouts, and Mexicans connected with the show took part. After riding round at full gallop, the whole of the band formed a long line and advanced, with Colonel Cody at their head, towards the grand stand. A race between a cowboy, a Mexican, and an Indian, on ponies, followed; after which an illustration was given of an attack by Indians on an emigrant waggon with equal vigour, the frontiersmen eventually driving off their assailants. Then came shooting feats by <span class="persName">Miss Oakley</span> and <span class="persName">Miss Smith</span>, a race between frontier girls, and the riding of bucking horses by cowboys. The exciting incident of the attack on the Dradwood<a href="../doc/n07" class="internal_link">7</a> stage coach by Indians, and the rescue by Buffalo Bill and his band of scouts, followed, and after this a realistic representation of Indian camp life was witnessed. The closing scene was the most exciting of the show. In the centre of the arena stood a settler's cabin, the head of the family having, it was to be presumed, just returned from a hunting expedition, when suddenly a hostile Indian appeared, and was promptly shot by the settler. A band of savages immediately rushed from all directions, and, after a desperate combat, the cabin seemed to be on the eve of capture when, with a ringing cheer, Buffalo Bill and his scouts dashed up and dispersed the Indian braves. At the conclusion the principal performers were presented to the Prince and Princess of Wales. The Indians seemed greatly to appreciate the Royal visit, and <span class="persName">Red Shirt</span>, to whom the Prince was introduced as the coming chief of the Pale Face Nation, said, through <span class="persName">Broncho Bill</span>, it made his heart glad that one so high above other men should visit him. Though his skin was red and the pale-faced chief's was white, their hearts were one. The Prince then handed Red Shirt a number of cigarettes, which the latter passed round to his companions. A number of relics of Indian fights were shown to the Royal party, including tomahawks, bows and arrows, and scalps. All the Royal visitors expressed themselves highly pleased with the exhibition, and on leaving the Prince warmly complimented Colonel Cody and the directors, and expressed the wish that the venture would prove a grand success.</p>
