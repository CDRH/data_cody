   <div class="note">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Hull, England, on July 1 and 2, 1904.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: Fenimore Chatterton (1860-1958) served two terms as Wyoming secretary of state from 1899 to 1907. Upon the death of Governor DeForest Richards (1846-1903) in April 1903, Chatterton became acting governor. As Cody indicates, Chatterton did not receive the Republican nomination for governor in 1904. Bryant B. Brooks (1861-1944) received the Republican nomination and was elected to serve out the remaining two years of Richards' term. Brooks took office in January 1905, with Chatterton remaining secretary of state until his own term expired in January 1907.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 3: Cody probably refers to Hinkle's appointment as deputy secretary of state of Wyoming in 1904.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 4: Probably a reference to Pahaska Tepee, a tourist lodge Cody built near the east entrance to Yellowstone National Park. Pahaska Tepee is located near the mouth of Middle Creek, which flows into the North Fork of the Shoshone River. Cody's small hotel at Pahaska was completed in 1904.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 5: William F. Cody organized a company called Cody's Wyoming Coal Company, which worked coal deposits near the Burlington Railroad right-of-way northeast of the town of Cody. The coal was not of high quality, and sold only in local markets. William F. Cody's stock certificates for this company were issued in February 1904.</div>
