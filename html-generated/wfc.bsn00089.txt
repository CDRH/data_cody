      <span class="persName">Mr. H. M. Gerrans</span>, 

Hotel Iroquios,

Buffalo, N. Y.

<span class="salute">Dear Mr. Gerrans:</span>

      <p>I send you herewith sales for December, also a statement of sales of each month in 1917 and 1916, so that you can make a comparison. We also enclose ledger balance as of December 31st, and I also enclose ledger balance of December 31, 1916.</p>

      <p>We have completed the inventory in all except the hardware department, and our stock is heavier than it was a year ago. This is accounted for on account of the great advance in the price of merchandise. We have endeavored to keep it down just as low as possible, and we have during the past year and intend to continue holding purchases to the very minimum.  We feel that almost all goods have been at the top notch cost and if some few things should go hither we simply will have to pay more, but we are not taking any chances on getting caught when the re-adjustment of costs takes place, with more goods than is necessary to continue in business. In other words, we are buying practically from hand to mouth.</p>

      <p>Our sales for 1917 were considerably more than 1916. The abnormal cost of goods has made a difference in our totals of from $10,000 to $17,500, and of course the higher selling price of merchandise has increased our business for the year, so that we cannot take credit that the entire increase is covered by turning out more merchandise, although I think that we did from ten to twelve and a half per cent more business in 1917, if prices had remained the same, than we did in 1916. Everything is going along very good.</p>

      <p>I expect to go to Omaha and Chicago some time this winter or spring, whenever I can get away, but cannot say when. I haven't been east since 1911 or 1912, and I must go back soon, so that if I should come I

will come on to Buffalo.</p>

      <p>I wish you would show these to <span class="persName">Mr. Rumsey</span>, so that he will know what is doing. I think we will show a reasonable profit for 1917. We have got things systematized and going much better <del>than</del> the last couple of years since we are selling for cash than we ever had before. It has been a question of being able to increase the cash business so that we will make something. Making a change from credit to cash it was sure to decrease the volume, but we feel we are getting it back to where it belongs, and where it was originally under the charge basis, so that we should do very well. </p>
