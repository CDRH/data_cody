Secretary of War
Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.


<span class="salute">Dear Sir;</span>




      <p>Adverting to our conversation of yesterday at Fort Logan I now beg at your kind suggestion to request that you will indorse the application which I am making to the Hon. the Secretary of the Department of the Interior for permission to enter the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation S.D. for the purpose of arranging and taking a moving picture reproduction of the last battles fought between United States troops and the North American Indians and ,also, a moving picture of the last surrender of hostile Indians to the United States army at Pine Ridge in the January of 1891. General Baldwin, who was present at that surrender has promised to take part in the work and we expect, also, that General Nelson A. Miles will cooperate. A reel of each picture taken will be presented to the War Department.</p>
