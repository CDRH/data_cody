      <h3>Otakte's Condition Unchanged.</h3>
      <p>
         <span class="persName">Otakte</span>, the young Indian chief, who is an inmate of Bellevue Hospital suffering from consumption, is still lying in a precarious condition. His recovery is extremely doubtful. It is believed that his disease was contracted in Europe, where he went as a member of the "Wild West" show. He belongs to the Dakota tribe of Sioux, and was a resident of the Pine Ridge Agency. His condition is being made as comfortable as possible. <span class="persName">Rev. Father Crafts</span>, of Dakota, is a frequent visitor to the young brave.</p>
