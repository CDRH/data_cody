      <p>"Buffalo Bill," Colonel W. F. Cody, passed through Omaha during the day en route to Washington to urge the Indian commissioner to rescind his recent order prohibiting Indians from leaving the reservations to travel with shows. He claims that the redskins are benefitted rather than injured as members of traveling organizations.</p>
