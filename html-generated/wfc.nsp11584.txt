      <h3>TWELVE OF THEM TAKEN IN CHARGE BY UNITED STATES SOLDIERS.</h3>

      <p>The Allan State Line steamship Corean, which yesterday arrived from Glasgow, had on board twenty-four Indians, who are returning home from the Wild West Show, which has been exhibiting in London. The number included the three chiefs, <span class="persName">Short Bull</span>, <span class="persName">Kicking Bear</span>, and <span class="persName">Lone Bull</span>. These, with nine others, were placed under arrest when the ship arrived. Short Bull was the alleged prophet of the "Messiah" during the late disturbances in the West, and to guard against any repetition of them the twelve suspects will be placed under military surveillance as soon as they arrive at Fort Jefferson.</p>

      <p>They were held as prisoners at Fort Sheridan, but were released on application of Col. Cody, who signed a bond for their return. They were met at the steamship pier by a Corporal and three privates from the army detachment stationed on Governors Island. This guard will accompany them to Chicago, where they will turn them over to another military escort, which will meet them at that point.</p>

      <p>The other dozen Indians are going to the Pine Ridge Agency. These also are returning on account of expiration of contract with Col. Cody. Fifteen others are left behind and are expected to arrive within the next few weeks. The party came under charge of <span class="persName">George A. Croger</span>, the Indian interpreter. He said that they would all take the midnight train for Chicago over the Baltimore and Ohio route. They were taken to the Stuttgart House, 22 Greenwich Street, for the night.</p>

      <p>Among the number are such euphoniously named Indians as Kill Crow, Holy Bird, and Charging Thunder. Medicine Horse, Plenty Blankets, and No Blankets are the names of the three squaws who are with the party.</p>
