Text from verso reads: THE WILD WEST—FORMING IN LINE. One of the most stirring items in Buffalo Bill's programme in this Wild West show at the American Exhibition, is the entry into the arena of the various members of the company, as one by one they dash out of their rocky fastnesses and ride wildly round the arena to what may be called the saluting point in front of the chief seats—when they rein suddenly in, and after saluting the spectators join their comrades and form a long thin line. A singular picturesque sight is afforded by this row of cowboys, vaqueros—Indians all in their peculiar attire, particularly when, as in our sketch, the Sioux chief, Red Shirt, ride up, being received with shrill whoops by his comrades, prior to the arrival on the scene of Buffalo Bill himself. A black and white version of this image ran in The Graphic on June 4, 1887 (see wfc.crt00016).</p>
