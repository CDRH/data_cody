      <h3>RIVAL SHOWS.</h3>
      <p>There is intense excitment at Hamburg<a href="../doc/n01" class="internal_link">1</a> over the fierce row that has occured between Buffalo Bill and <span class="persName">Dr. Carver</span>. People are afraid to come out of doors after dark, and the place in a state of siege. The members of each troup have openly declared their intention of fighting their masters, even if the quarrel ends in a general fight. There can be no doubt that it is only through the efforts of the civil authorities that blood-shed up to the present time has been avoided.</p>

      <p>Carver has been following Cody all through the later's tour of the cities of the continent, and his performances have been much better patronized than Buffalo Bill's. Jealously was aroused. Cody announced his intention of staying some time in Hamburg.</p>

      <p>Carver then stole a march on his rival. He arrived in Hamburg three day ahead, and opened up his wild west show in fine style. When Cody arrived here he found that he would have to pitch his tent within a few feet of Carver's show. Carver had made arrangements for an exclusive supply of electric lights, and this left Cody's place in the dark. Then the members of both camps took up the matter, and it was only through their strenuous effort that a fearful fight has been prevented. Hamburg has been filled with a howling mob of Indians and cowboys, who are waiting a chance to scalp each other.</p>

      <p>The town is covered with the posters of both parties. As soon as Cody's bills are posted up Carver's men come along and tear them down and put their own in place.</p>

      <p>The bad blood between Cody and Carver has aroused such a jealous feeling among their Indian and cowboy followers that serious trouble is expected at any moment. It is an open secret that while Carver made an enormous business in Berlin and Vienna Cody fell flat, and Carver's men are going round spreading that fact, and saying the Bill's failure is due to his inferior show. Sunday both Cody and Carver opened at the same time. Both shows are in the center of Hamburg. Carver gave two performances and held 30,000 people, while Cody gave one, which was attended by 7,000 persons.</p>
