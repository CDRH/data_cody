<span class="salute">Dear Mr. Bleistein:-</span>


      <p>I have your telegram and enclose a bill for the purchase price of the dog, $10.00 and express charges. I thought I would prepay <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="express​ ">wxpress</a>
    ​ charges so that you would not be bothered at that end. I hope he arrives there in good condition. The man I bought the dog from happens to be out in the hills and I will be unable to get the pedigree for possibly a week or 10 days. As soon as I get it will send it along.</p>
