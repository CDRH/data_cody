         <div class="center">Buffalo Bill at Windsor.</div>
      </h3>

      <p>The <span class="persName">Queen</span> having expressed her wish to the Chum to Potentates<a href="../doc/n01" class="internal_link">1</a> that the Wild West Show should appear before Her Majesty at Windsor Castle, your correspondent escorted that body into the royal presence on Tuesday last.</p>

      <p>A large audience of Nobles had assembled to do honor to the aristocratic redmen of the far West, and the Royal Maroon Band played "Lo, the Conquering Hero Comes," as the tribes bowed their respects to Her Majesty. The braves in honor of the occasion wore a new coat of paint and the regulation three feathers in their back hair--a costume which was at once effective and gentlemanly, if, as an old authority on dress has said, "A gentleman's dress is never conspicuous."</p>

      <p>A large space in front of the castle had been cleared for the performance, and after a light luncheon <span class="persName">Mr. Nate Salsbury</span> mounted a pedestal from which the statue of William the Conqueror<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> had been temporarily removed, and explained to Her Majesty that the Comanche tribe from the suburbs of Boston, would now see how near they could come to running over Prince Battenberg<a href="../doc/n03" class="internal_link">3</a> without really hurting him.</p>

         <p>HIGH LIFE IN NEW YORK.</p>
      </div>

      <p>This was followed by an exhibition at shooting, when Buffalo Bill shot the Koh-i-noor<a href="../doc/n04" class="internal_link">4</a> out of the Queen's Spring crown seven times running, much to the delight of her Majesty and the wonder of the assembled Nobles.</p>

      <p>Several cow-ladies were then introduced, giving British aristocracy a fair imitation of high life in New York city. The Queen was much surprised at the refined way in which American ladies do their shopping on bucking ponies, and when one of the young ladies with auburn hair showed with what facility American girls use their firearms when their young gentleman friends decline to take them to the opera, the royal family was nearly carried away with delight.</p>

      <p>At the request of the Chum Mr. Buffalo Bill gave a graphic representation of New York's first families on their way to church. The old camp-wagon was brought out and Mr. Cody disguised as Mr. Vanastorbilt, stepped up on the box and started the horses off. Grace Church was represented by a canvas tent, and Fourteenth Street was shown by a pole stuck in the ground. The Queen could hardly restrain herself when the team ran away, and the nimble Buffalo Bill, tying a lasso around his waist, stopped them by casting the noose over a stump on which were growing some wistaria vines and which was supposed to represent a lamp-post. Her Majesty had heard of Mr. Vanastorbilt, but never supposed he was so clever a man.</p>

      <p>Then, as the carriage neared Fourteenth Street, the low, ominous war-cry of the Sioux Indians was heard, and the faithful picture of New York life that then followed, with its awful butchery and bellowing of buffaloes on Union Square, needs no description for your readers who have grown so familiar with it in the daily round of life. Suffice it to say that the British aristocracy fairly yelled with joy as Mr. Vanastorbilt slew file after file of the attacking party, losing only his scalp and four children in the melee.</p>

      <p>The exhibition was closed by a pastoral scene showing how the Indians and whites live peacefully together in Philadelphia, with an allegorical tableau at the end, showing a six-foot Comanche labeled William Penn, standing beside a small four-inch stage sword, the significance of which Her Majesty immediately perceived, for as she left the grounds she spoke of the pathetic rendering of the old proverb, "The Comanche is mightier than the dagger."</p>

      <p>In return for the pleasure he had given her, Buffalo Bill and "Potato-Faced-Charley"<a href="../doc/n05" class="internal_link">5</a> were invested with the Order of

the Bath<a href="../doc/n06" class="internal_link">6</a>--which the Indian declined from natural scruples, not understanding the idiomatic significance of the decoration.</p>

      <p>On the whole the day passed off pleasantly, and there were no disturbances other than a slight misunderstanding between the Prince of Wales and a young Sioux brave, in which the Prince's baldness served him in good stead.</p>

      <p>It is rumored that the National Gallery of London has offered one of the Indians a large salary if he will annex himself to the Turner Gallery,<a href="../doc/n07" class="internal_link">7</a> and exhibit the sunset that he wears on the small of his back when he goes to war. The trustees of the Gallery claim to have internal evidence that the painting is by the hand of the master, and that it must be had at any cost.</p>

      <p>It seems to me that this affords the United States a chance to settle the fishery question by swapping off the artistic brave for justice--and the only way to get justice from the English Government is to pay for it.</p>

      <p>Her Majesty's desire to see these untutored savages in their native lair may induce her to visit New York next season, in which case she will probably be under the management of D'Oyly Carte.<a href="../doc/n08" class="internal_link">8</a>
