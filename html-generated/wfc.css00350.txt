      <span class="salute">Dear General Scott:</span>



      <p>I am glad to say I am putting together a fine Show, to open at some point in Oklahoma, April 26th, 1916. From there we work East. The title of the Show will be: "Buffalo Bills Military Pageant in War and Peace."</p>

      <p>The main object will be to enthuse the American people for Preparedness. I am lecturing on Preparedness now and am most liberally applauded, but with the Big Show I can do ten times as much more. I would like the men furloughed about April 15th for six months, and I'll send transportation and expenses to them, in ample time. Could the men bring their full equipment (saddle, arms, etc.?) and would it be possible to have a rapid fire gun and Squad to use it? I want to do it right so as to create enthusiasm which will put the young men of America thinking of enlisting. I want to make this Show wake up every American and realize the true situation. I am sure it will be the means of doing much good; consequently I want the Military part of it perfect.</p>

      <p>My permanent address is: 16 Ferdinand Place, New Rochelle, N.Y. </p>

         <span class="salute">Yours faithfully,</span>

         <br/>W. F. Cody
