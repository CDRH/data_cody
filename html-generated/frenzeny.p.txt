      <div class="note">Paul Frenzeny (1840-1902) was born in France and served in the French cavalry in Mexico before being hired by <em class="hi">Harper's</em> as part of a United States sketching tour with fellow artist Jules Tavernier in 1873. Together, the artistic team traveled by rail through Missouri, Kansas, and Texas, completing sketches and scenes documenting the frontier. Frenzeny settled in San Francisco and continued to illustrate for <em class="hi">Harper's</em> and <em class="hi">Frank Leslie's Illustrated Weekly,</em> among other newspapers. Frenzeny's drawings appear in some of Buffalo Bill's Wild West promotional material, including posters and programs. Eventually, Frenzeny returned to New York. He died in London in 1902.</div>
