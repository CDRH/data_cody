      <p>What will the people at Irma<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> do for water when the ditch is not running this winter. Will they not have to have <u>cistern</u>? If so had they not better be built this fall. I know <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="that's​ ">thats</a>

   <div class="note">Note 1: BBWW performed in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on September 3, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "Green Bay, Wis. / Thursday, September 3. Arrived in town at 3.30 A. M. One and one-half mile haul to lot. The weather turned very cold to-night—the coldest day of the season. There was the largest concert house this afternoon that we ever had—every reserve seat was taken, and George Fursman smiled as we have never seen him smile before, and even "Pop" Rasey was pleased. / Business, big in the afternoon, fair at night. / Lot, Webster avenue and Polier street. / Arena, 190 x 408."</div>
