Arrived in town at 3.30 A. M. One and one-half mile haul to lot. The weather turned very cold to-night—the coldest day of the season. There was the largest concert house this afternoon that we ever had—every reserve seat was taken, and George Fursman smiled as we have never seen him smile before, and even "Pop" Rasey was pleased. / Business, big in the afternoon, fair at night. / Lot, Webster avenue and Polier street. / Arena, 190 x 408."<a href="#n01.ref"> [back]</a>
