      <h3>LONDON LETTER.</h3>
      <span class="dateline">LONDON, MONDAY NIGHT.</span>
      <p>Traces of the Buffalo Bill "rage" are still to be found among London nick-nacks, and one of the handsomest is a bronze figure which I saw this afternoon at a fashionable West End establishment. It is a representation of Colonel Cody on his favourite white charger, and it is a really striking work. The American horseman carries his Winchester repeater in his right hand, and every detail of his somewhat striking attire is faithfully brought out. "Bill's" features and prominent mustachios have been reproduced in the cast with equal success, and, even apart from the romantic interest which attaches to the subject, the ornament is one which many people would like to see on their mantelshelves.</p>
