      <h3>AMERICAN BRONCHO HORSES v. ENGLISH THOROUGHBREDS.</h3>
      <h3>TEN MILES RACE FOR £500 A-SIDE.</h3>
      <p>The second match between the English thoroughbred horses and bronchos supplied from the Wild West stud was decided yesterday before another large attendance of spectators. The conditions were slightly different from those of Tuesday, as yesterday the jockeys had to change their mounts without any assistance. The jockeys were J. Latham and <span class="persName">A. Esquivel</span> (the American), who had to change horses each half-mile, and although the Englishman's mounts showed much the greater pace the alacrity with which the American mounted and dismounted fully counter-balanced any advantage that the Englishman gained in this respect. Immediately on starting the Englishman got off with a short lead, and passed the post slightly ahead at the end of the first lap, and also effected a further advantage in his change, but owing to a collision the completion of the next lap, through an American horse getting on the track, he lost his lead, and the American quickly went to the head of affairs. Latham then gradually lessened the gap, but the American by his splendid dismounting rapidly gained and increased his lead to a couple of furlongs. The American then lost a considerable amount of ground, but Latham never succeeded in making anything like a diminution of his opponent's long lead, the American winning, amidst tumultuous applause, by 400 yards. Time, 22 minutes.</p>
