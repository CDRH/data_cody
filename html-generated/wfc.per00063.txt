            <span class="l">In case you should not know,</span>
            <span class="l indent">My well instructed quill</span>
            <span class="l">Now scribbles to tell 'tis a season of woe</span>
            <span class="l indent">When you ought to look dumpish and ill.</span>
         </span>

         <span class="lg">
            <span class="l">The news is sad, and oh!</span>
            <span class="l indent">It might go nigh to kill;</span>
            <span class="l">But nerve yourselves stoutly for meeting the blow,—</span>
            <span class="l indent">You are losing your Buffalo Bill!</span>
         </span>

         <span class="lg">
            <span class="l">Alas! that great hero</span>
            <span class="l indent">Of many sided skill</span>
            <span class="l">Is leaving the country: yes, he and his show,</span>
            <span class="l indent">And never more cheer us they will.</span>
         </span>

         <span class="lg">
            <span class="l">While Chamberlain, our Joe,—</span>
            <span class="l indent">Ah, what a bitter pill!—</span>
            <span class="l">Has, in spite of our feelings, determined to go</span> 
            <span class="l indent">Out of England, like Buffalo Bill.</span>

         <span class="lg">
            <span class="l">Our tears may overflow,</span>
            <span class="l indent">Our cup of grief may fill, </span>
            <span class="l">Yet upon us this year he no more will bestow</span>
            <span class="l indent">Written wisdom or speeches that thrill.</span>
         </span>

         <span class="lg">
            <span class="l">To part's a painful throe;</span>
            <span class="l indent">The shock is crushing;—still</span>
            <span class="l">We must try to survive without eloquent Joe</span>
            <span class="l indent">And the wonderful Buffalo Bill! </span>
