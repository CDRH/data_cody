Mr. <span class="persName">John Tait</span>,
Oracle, Ariz.


<span class="salute">Dear Tait:</span>


      <p>Your kind letter received. We have opened and have a very good show, indeed.<a href="../doc/n01" class="internal_link">1</a> I think that business will be very good here, as the papers have given us splendid notices. Of course we miss Baker more than words can express.<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> We also miss you and all the old guard.</p>

      <p>I am not appearing in the saddle this season, but drive in my carriage and I have sure got the prettiest pair of horses, and most sensible horses and the finest team I ever drove, and the people say that I look like "six bits" when I drive them into the arena and make my little talk and introduce <span class="persName">Major Lillie</span>.</p>

      <p>Tait, I wish that you would write me your candid opinion regarding "Morning Star" and whether you think that it is going to be a big winner or not. Also where "Black Jack" is and what he is doing, and how everything is getting along at camp.<a href="../doc/n03" class="internal_link">3</a> Anything that your write me will be treated as strictly confidential.</p>

      <p>Now, Tait, I am very busy and not very well. I often wish for you and, sooner or later, I would like to have you with me all the time, but first I have to see how the "cat is going to jump". I am very busy, and have so many letters to write, etc., and whether I write you or not, you keep on writing me. Good Luck.</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours very truly,</span>

         <br/>Governor

   <div class="note">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West Combined with Pawnee Bill's Great Far East opened its 1913 season in Philadelphia on April 3, 1913. Performances in Philadelphia continued until April 19.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: "Baker" is almost certainly <span class="persName">Lewis H. "Johnny" Baker</span> (1868-1931).</div>

   <div class="note">Note 3: "Morning Star" was one of the mining claims owned by Cody and his partner <span class="persName">Daniel Burns Dyer</span> near the town of Oracle, Arizona. Cody lost large sums of money in unsuccessful mining investments in Arizona in the last years of his life. "Black Jack" may be John Garden, who reportedly helped to locate tungsten ore at the Morning Star property in 1913. Little else is known of him.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 4: "LHC" may be the initials of a typist who prepared the letter for Cody's signature.</div>
