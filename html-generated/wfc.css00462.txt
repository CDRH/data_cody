   <div class="note">Note 1: The year is not inscribed by Cody but is 1895 as determined by the Routes List: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Atlanta, Georgia, from October 28 - November 2, 1895, during the run of The Cotton States and International Exposition, also known as the Atlanta Exposition. </div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: In 1895 Buffalo Bill's Wild West closed the season in Atlanta on November 2nd.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 3: Billings and Red Lodge, Montana, were the two closest rail line links to Cody, Wyoming.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 4: "Mac Tagues Omaha" probably refers to James Hugh McTague (1858-1926) who was the owner of a catering service in Omaha, Nebraska, as well as opening the first basement saloon with partner Charles Little under the name of Little &amp; McTague. McTague later opened a European-style hotel in Omaha before relocating to Missouri around 1900.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 5: "Bedding or grub" refers to provisions for the hunting trip Cody and others were planning to make in late November or early December.</div>
