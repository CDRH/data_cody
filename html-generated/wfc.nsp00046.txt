                <h3>THE CHARGE UP SAN JUAN HILL.</h3>
                <h3>Rough Riders, with Buffalo Bill, to Reproduce It in Washington.</h3>
                
                <p>One of the leading features of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, which exhibits in Washington April 19 and 20, is a vivid reproduction of the heroic charge up San Juan hill. This part of the programme alone requires the services of 600 persons, and in it are many of the Rough Riders who were actual actors in the real battle. Among them is Tom Isbel, who has the honor of being the first man who fired on the Spaniards on the morning of the affray. He received in return eight bullets from the enemy, and now carries many scars as the result of his bravery. Cubans, who acted as guides and who participated in other battles, are also engaged, along with Porto Ricans, who took part in different engagements. A company of artillery will also be brought from the regular army to take part in this production.</p>
                
                <p>The cowboys will ride bucking bronchos, the Indians will engage warfare in their own peculiar style, the Cossacks will perform marvelous feats on the horse, the Arabs have new acrobatic feats that are astounding, the Germans will drill with the sword, the English will give exercises with the lance, and other features of interest will be shown, making this year's Wild West more complete and more enjoyable than ever before. Maj. J. M. Burke, an old Washingtonian, is now in town as advance agent of the Wild West Show.</p>
