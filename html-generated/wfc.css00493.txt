from Mar. 1<u>st</u> if so he should have it. That<del>s</del> is while he done good honest work but not while he was <u>drinking</u>. I <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="don't​ ">dont</a>
    ​ see how a man can drink. I am still getting it from Salsbury because I took a few drinks out there the last time I was there. I am going to get the State legislature to pass an act allowing me to find some secluded canon where I can be allowed to go to and take a drink if I choose to— Salsbury says New York and long Branch is good enough for him. then I <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="don't​ ">dont</a>

   <div class="note">Note 1: BBWW performed in Newark, Ohio, on July 14, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "Newark, Ohio. / Tuesday, July 14. Arrived in town 4 A. M. Three-quarter mile haul to lot. A Newark paper of this evening, in commenting upon the parade, said 'that the Show had two steam caliopes, but they could not play either one of them, but that the people appreciated them just the same.' Kinura, the Japanese magician of the Annex, closed to-day on account of ill health and left for New York. This is the French Fourth of July, and the French soldiers did all they could in a  small way to celebrate. Just as the audience was dismissed this evening we had the hardest rain of the season. It was more severe than any of us had ever witnessed--old showmen having never seen its equal. It put out a beacon-light, and, as is quite a common case, the electric street railway was disabled just as the people desired to get home. All our teams had to be doubled in order to get our stuff all off of the lot, and the last wagon did not leave until 12.30. / Business in the afternoon big, in the evening light. / Lot, 14th and Church streets. / Arena, 181 x 386."</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: "Flood" is likely D. P. Flood who wrote to Beck in 1896 and is mentioned by Cody in correspondence to Beck. Flood may have been a foreman or livestock handler employed on the irrigation project; his exact role is not known.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 3: "Meade" is Elwood Mead.</div>
