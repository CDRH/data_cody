  Essanay Film Company,
  Chicago, Illinois.
  
  <span class="salute">Gentlemen:</span>




      <p>Under date of February 2, 1916, the Department wrote you that it had never received a set of the moving picture films taken on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, South Dakota, during the latter part of the year 1913, although it was the understanding, as well as the expressed desire of Colonel W. F. Cody, that the Interior Department be furnished with these reels. It is understood that a similar arrangement was had with the War Department, and that that Department did receive its pictures.</p>
      <p>As you were previously advised, this Department had some correspondence with Colonel Cody, and in his letter of February 1st he stated that he was at a loss to understand why the agreement had not been carried out as far as the Interior Department was concerned, and that he would write your company with reference to the matter.</p>
      <p>Up to this time we have not received the promised films, nor has a reply to Department letter of February 1st
