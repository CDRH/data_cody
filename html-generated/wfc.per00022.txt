      <p>From a letter just received from Mr. F. A. Tipton, associated with Mr. E. T. Lux, exhibiting the moving pictures of the Buffalo Bill Wild West and Pawnee Bill Far East Show, we note these two gentlemen are meeting with unexpected success throughout the whole state of Pennsylvania.  Mr. Tipton is working the western half, leaving the eastern section to Mr. Lux.  From Mr. Craft, general manager of the company in New York, we learn that an extra set of pictures has been ordered by both Pennsylvania representatives, the Western man having booked his first set for a period of 16 weeks in advance, at the regular booking price of such pictures. </p>
