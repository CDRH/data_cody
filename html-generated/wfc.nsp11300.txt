                <h3>SUIT OVER WILD WEST FILMS.</h3>
                <h3>
         <strong>"Buffalo Bill" and "Pawnee Bill" Want $25,000 for Posing.</strong>
      </h3>
                <p>Supreme Court Justice Gerard reserved decision yesterday on an application of William F. Cody ("Buffalo Bill") and Gordon W. Lillie ("Pawnee Bill") for an injunction restraining Patrick A. Powers and Pliny P. Craft from using moving pictures that the plaintiffs posed for. They are asking $25,000 as their share of the proceeds from the pictures now in use in theatres.</p>
                <p>According to the plaintiffs a contract was entered into between the parties now in litigation in June, 1910. Craft and Powers were to have the right to put on small moving picture plays of Western scenes in which "Buffalo Bill" and "Pawnee Bill" were to pose, and were to receive $25,000 and a percentage of the profits. As a result of a dispute over certain payments Cody and Lillie refused to act any more, and they were sued for $1,000,000. The suit was settled. Now the plaintiffs allege that contrary to a new agreement Powers and Craft have placed on the market 8,000 feet of film under the name of the Buffalo Bill and Pawnee Bill Film Company. The plaintiffs maintain that these films will lessen the demand for future pictures, and will deprive them of their profits.</p>
