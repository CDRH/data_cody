And George— when you pay Nagle any more commission hold out $1.050— for me. Well I sent my old faithful Charley Trego to take charge— Grouard is not working for me now. George give Trego all the advice and assistance you can. he will appre

And I would not expect pay until the company is in condition to pay. the company has got to have the work done sooner or later. Trego<a href="../doc/n04" class="internal_link">4</a> will do your freighting as cheap as any one— Foote<a href="../doc/n05" class="internal_link">5</a> will be out about the 10<u>th</u>.
