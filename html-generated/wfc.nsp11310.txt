      </h3>
                
                <p>Catching the popular interest at a psychological moment the Essanay Company offers a timely special, the release date of which will shortly be announced.</p>
                
                <p>It is "The Life of Buffalo Bill and the Indian Wars," a film produced under the auspices of the United States government as a historical record of the forming of the West. William F. Cody the great plainsman and a romantic figure in the building of the Nation, is shown throughout his life and battles. Buffalo Bill himself plays the leading role.</p>
                
                <p>Many Indians, regiments of United States soldiers and scores of scouts take part in this feature.</p>
                
                <p>As it stands "The Life of Buffalo Bill" is an hour and ten minutes of Indian battles and prairie skirmishes, its exciteing moments contrasting with its pathos, its amusing situations fitting in with the daring and dangerous humor of the frontiersmen.</p>
                
                <p>The home life of Cody, from the murder of his father when he was a small boy to his old age is pictured. It shows him as the adventurous boy in Missouri before the Civil War, compelled to take up scouting as a competitor of full grown men to provide for the family. It shows him as a pony express rider before he had reached his majority.</p>
                
                <p>His skill at killing bison, which won for him the title of Buffalo Bill, is also exhibited. Many noted Indian chieftains appear in the battle scenes.</p>
