   <div class="note">Note 1: The year is not inscribed by Cody but is 1895 as determined by the Routes List: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Montpelier, Vermont, on July 24, 1895. </div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: "Higby" was likely Anson Higby (b. 1862), a banker in Deadwood, S.D., who in 1893 partnered with Mr. C. H. Grinnell (later Mayor of Sheridan), J. R. Phelan, and George T. Beck to form the Sheridan Fuel Company on lands approximately four miles north of Sheridan. This area soon became a thriving company-owned mining camp known as Higby. Higby became president of the Basin State Bank in Basin, Wyoming, as well as mayor and baseball coach of the town. He was the secretary for the Wyoming State Fair board for about five years beginning in 1913. Higby was elected to the board of directors for several emerging oil-gas companies including the Flat Top Oil &amp; Gas Company, the Emery Oil Company, the Glenhurst Company, and worked for the Midwest Refining Company out of Casper, Wyoming.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 3: "Leighter" might have been misspelled by Cody, who may have been referring to one of these two men who had major investments in the Sheridan area: Levi Z. Leiter (1834-1904), a businessman from Chicago with extensive business interests in Wyoming, including ranching, mining, and the development of water resources; or Joseph Leiter (1868-1932), only son of Levi Leiter, who was a self-described capitalist. Joseph Leiter managed the business affairs of his father and then of his father's estate starting in 1904 which included four ranches in Wyoming. Joseph Leiter was a major force with the Lake DeSmet Water Project in Johnson County, the second Kearney Lake Company, and other irrigation projects that serve croplands to this day. </div>

   <div class="note">Note 4: "Sulphur Springs" is likely Cody's reference to "DeMaris Springs," a warm sulphur spring located in the middle of the original Cody City town site.</div>
