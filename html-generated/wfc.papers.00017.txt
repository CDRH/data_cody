        <h3>Exporting American Exceptionalism: The Wild West in Germany</h3>

        <h3>Boundary Markers and Border Crossers, Fifty-Second Annual Conference of the
          Western History Association, October 7, 2012.</h3>

        <p>The meanings of the Wild West's frontier iconography varied according to cultural
          context. When Buffalo Bill crossed the borders into the newly-formed Germany—a society in
          need of narratives to underwrite its nationalist project—he encountered fertile ground for
          his tales of the conquest of the American West and the belligerent yet nostalgic portrayal
          of Native Americans. However, the reasons for the fascination with the West differ quite
          significantly between American and German audiences. This paper will discuss the
          differences in reception, based on German newspaper accounts, linking them to the
          particular cultural climate of turn-of-the-century Germany with its mix of nationalist and
          provincial concerns. Furthermore, this paper will address the Wild West's legacy for
          German writers such as Karl May, whose 'Winnetou' series still enjoys remarkable
          popularity in Germany today. Overall, the paper argues that despite the enthusiasm for the
          West, Germans (and other Europeans) did not unequivocally accept the American ideologies
          behind the spectacle but, instead, focused on those elements that reflected their own
          cultural priorities. Thus, the traditional tale of Buffalo Bill's Wild West as a vehicle
          for the Americanization of Europe has to be revised and complicated. </p>
