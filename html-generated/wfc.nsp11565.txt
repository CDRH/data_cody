      <h6 class="fw">SUNDAY, APRIL 22, 1888.</h6>

      <p>The challenge we published last week, in which a gentleman named Goodall wished to contest ten miles on the racecourse with English horses against Buffalo Bill's ponies, has met with a response. We have received the following from Buffalo Bill:—</p>

      <span class="floatingText">

         <span class="dateline">Wild West Camp, Manchester, <br/>
April 21, 1888.</span>
         <span class="salute">Mr. B. Goodall.</span>
         <p>Dear Sir,—Having succeeded, through the kindness of Mr. Mark Price and the racecourse authorities, in securing the grounds for the proposed race between your English-bred horses and my American ponies, I accept your proposition. The terms the same as you suggested—namely, for £200, the same number of horses for a ten mile contest—riders to change every half-mile. While my ponies are the ordinary cattle ponies of the Far West, I think the experiment will be one of great interest.—I am, respectfully yours,</p>
         <span class="closer">
            <br/>W. F. CODY (Buffalo Bill),</span>
