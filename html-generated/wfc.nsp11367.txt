      <p>Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show has sailed from New York for England on board the Nebraska.<a href="../doc/n01" class="internal_link">1</a> The scene on the deck at the time of starting was very animated. Most of the 100 Indians and squaws were evidently very nervous over the dangers of the ocean. They will sleep in improvised bunks along the ship’s sides between decks. The horses occupy stalls on deck. The Buffaloes and elk are in the lower hold. A great crowd assembled to see the departure of the steamer.</p>
