         <span class="head">Colonel Cody <em class="hi">The</em> "Old Scout" Here for the Park County Fair, September 16, 17, 18,</span>
      </div>
      <p>The arrival of Colonel Cody yesterday sets the memory to working. World-wide is the fame of the man who has done so much for this particular portion of Wyoming.</p>
    
      <p>Colonel Cody, "Buffalo Bill", came yesterday. Back to the old stamping ground, back to the country than whom no man as done as much to make famous as he; back to the bright land of his early love, where in the olden days when the Indians resented forceably the intrusion of the white men. And with him comes Johnny Baker, John Tate, Carlos Miles, and some of the rest of the men who have helped him make the wild west famous in the far east.</p>
    
      <p>Full of enthusiasm is Colonel Cody. Five minutes talking with him is equal to a day in Wyoming's unequalled mountain air. One feels like getting up on his toes and doing something. The Park County Fair will lack nothing to make it a success if it is up to the Colonel and his party. He has come a long way to help his home town in the hour of need, and such entertainment as he and his party will furnish during those days next week will be worth going any number of miles to see. There will be roping of the kind seldom witnessed. There will be bucking of the sort to make one's hair stand on end.</p>
    
      <p>Surely excitement will run high, for Colonel Cody is home.</p>
    
      <p>Colonel Cody personally offers a prize of $25 in cash for the best dressed man, and $25 more for the best dressed woman to take part in the parade Tuesday morning. Just the real western, the real Wyoming style is what is wanted. Simplicity and thoroughness of equipment will probably be the points considered in awarding these prizes.</p>
    
      <p>Preparations are being made to make this the biggest parade ever witnessed in this part of the country, and every cowboy and cowgirl in the county, or outside of the county, is wanted on that day. Whomsoever has a saddle and a pony is urged to be in Cody next Tuesday morning and take part in that parade.</p>
