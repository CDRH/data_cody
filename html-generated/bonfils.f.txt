   </h3>
   <p>
      <div class="note">Frederick Gilmer Bonfils was born in Troy, Missouri, in 1860. He attended West Point from 1878 to 1881 but left the academy without graduating. Bonfils became a financial success through land speculation in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. In 1895 Bonfils and Harry Heye Tammen bought the struggling <em class="hi">Denver Post</em>. Bonfils and Tammen built the Post into Colorado's largest-circulation newspaper through the practice of highly sensationalistic journalism amidst a bitter rivalry with the <em class="hi">Rocky Mountain News</em>. Bonfils and Tammen were partners in several other businesses, including the <em class="hi">Kansas City Post</em> (1909-1922) and the Sells-Floto Circus (1904-1921). Bonfils was known for his quick temper, becoming involved in physical altercations with several political and business rivals over the years. In 1907 he was convicted of assaulting the publisher of the rival <em class="hi">Rocky Mountain News</em>. Bonfils died in 1933, apparently feared by many but truly loved by few in Denver.</div>
