      <div class="milestone line"> </div>

      <p>Some of the Indians and American cowboys from Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show visited Windsor Castle yesterday. The party, which included the Sioux chieftain <span class="persName">

The Indians were attired in their bright-coloured native costumes, several carried Japanese fans, and all had their faces painted. <span class="persName">

Arriving in the Royal borough soon after ten o’clock in the morning, the Red Men and their companions were taken to the Castle, and shown through the State apartments, with whose magnificence they were greatly impressed. They also ascended to the battlements of the Round Tower, promenaded the Palace terraces, and walked through the Royal stables, which were, unfortunately, somewhat empty, many of the <span class="persName">

The Indians after a couple of hours’ sightseeing appeared fatigued, and half a dozen at a time would suddenly seat themselves upon the pavement to rest, while their companions continued their inspection. From the mews the party proceeded to the Albert Chapel and St. George’s<a name="n03.ref"> </a>
         <a href="#n03.note" class="ref">3</a>, where the visit terminated. They subsequently returned to the Great Western Station<a name="n04.ref"> </a>
         <a href="#n04.note" class="ref">4</a> and thronged the refreshment bar until the time for the return train to start. </p>
