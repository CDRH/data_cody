I have a nice little 160 acre farm ten miles from Cody— a nice six room log house on it all fenced the river runs through it. the finest pure water spring in the country close to the house I have put a man and wife on it. to raise chickens. make butter. And next year vegetables for the hotel— the chickens &amp; butter will be ready for the hotel Sep 15th. This will be the hotel farm. </p>
