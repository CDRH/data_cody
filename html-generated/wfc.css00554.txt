      <p>Did you do anything about a petition to the President<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> about the high line canal<a href="../doc/n03" class="internal_link">3</a>? </p>

      <p>I will play Washington<a href="../doc/n04" class="internal_link">4</a> May 18th &amp; 19th.  And if I can do anything by seeing the President let me know. I would be pleased to have a letter from you.</p>

      <p>The old Wild West will open the 21st.</p>
