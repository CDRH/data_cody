                <p>ORANGE, N. J., May 24. — Arrangements are being made at the Edison laboratory in West Orange for the taking of the biggest moving picture ever attempted. This is to be a series of scenes illustrating the entire performance of Buffalo Bill's Wild West. To make this picture as proposed 18,000 feet of film will be required and 96,000 separate pictures will be taken. The film to be used will be all in one piece, and will be the longest ever made. The figures when thrown on the screen will be life size.</p>
