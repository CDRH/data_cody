      <h3>A PEEP AT BUFFALO BILL'S WILD WEST.</h3>

      <span class="lg">
         <span class="lg">
            <span class="l">To lasso the Buffalo on the plains,</span>
            <span class="l indent">To drive the wolf from its lair,</span>
            <span class="l">To run and race at break-neck pace,</span>
            <span class="l indent">To shoot at the hungry bear,</span>
         </span>

         <span class="lg">
            <span class="l">Away from the haunts of men to go</span>
            <span class="l indent">And follow his own sweet will,</span>
            <span class="l">O this was the sort of life, and the sport</span>
            <span class="l indent">That suited Buffalo Bill!</span>
         </span>

         <span class="lg">
            <span class="l">The whole Wild West was open to him;</span>
            <span class="l indent">And there he could freely roam,</span>
            <span class="l">And under the trees could live at his ease,</span>
            <span class="l indent">And make himself quite at home.</span>
         </span>


         <span class="lg">
            <span class="l">The dream of his boyhood it had been</span>
            <span class="l indent">To live in the wild-wood free</span>
            <span class="l">Like a pioneer, and to chase the deer</span>
            <span class="l indent">With others as wild as he.</span>
         </span>

         <span class="lg">
            <span class="l">So steady his hand and so sure his aim</span>
            <span class="l indent">As he flung out the light lasso,</span>
            <span class="l">That in the loop of his line he'd scoop</span>
            <span class="l indent">The terrible Buffalo.</span>
         </span>

         <span class="lg">
            <span class="l">The ways of the wild-ox well he learned—</span>
            <span class="l indent">And such was his nerve and skill</span>
            <span class="l">In snaring this game, that he won great fame,</span>
            <span class="l indent">And the name of Buffalo Bill.</span>
         </span>

         <span class="l">But out in the land of the setting sun,</span>
         <span class="l indent">The savages made their home,</span>
         <span class="l">And in search of food o'er mountain and wood</span>
         <span class="l indent">The red men were wont to roam.</span>
      </span>
      <span class="lg">
         <span class="l">And oft they would cross the great frontier</span>
         <span class="l indent">The white men to rob and slay,</span>
         <span class="l">And troops were sent by the government</span>
         <span class="l indent">To keep the wretches at bay.</span>
      </span>
      <span class="lg">
         <span class="l">Swiftly the arrows rushed through the air,</span>
         <span class="l indent">Loudly the guns replied;</span>
         <span class="l">And red and white took part in the fight</span>
         <span class="l indent">And the dead were on either side.</span>
      </span>
      <span class="lg">
         <span class="l">The savages knew every inch of the ground,</span>
         <span class="l indent">Very crafty were they and sly,</span>
         <span class="l">And with loosened rein o'er the level plain</span>
         <span class="l indent">With wonderful speed did they fly.</span>
      </span>
      <span class="lg">

         <span class="l">O brave and bold must the white man be</span>
         <span class="l indent">Who follows the red man's track,</span>
         <span class="l">By day and night prepared to fight</span>
         <span class="l indent">And parry the fierce attack.</span>
      </span>
      <span class="lg">
         <span class="l">With eye as keen as an eagle's own, </span>
         <span class="l indent">With a steady hand and nerve</span>
         <span class="l">He must stand in his place, and the foeman face,</span>
         <span class="l indent">And never from duty swerve.</span>
      </span>
      <span class="lg">
         <span class="l">The troops press on with a steady march,</span>
         <span class="l indent">With pistols and guns supplied;</span>
         <span class="l">But as brave as they are they cannot go far</span>
         <span class="l indent">Without a reliable guide;</span>
      </span>
      <span class="lg">
         <span class="l">And happy are they in meeting with one</span>
         <span class="l indent">So worthy this post to fill,</span>
         <span class="l">For there couldn't be found in the country around</span>
         <span class="l indent">Such a scout as Buffalo Bill.</span>

      </span>
      <span class="lg">
         <span class="l">He had seen them oft in bloodthirsty mood, </span>

      </span>
      <span class="lg">
         <span class="l">The fagots were lit, and around and around</span>

      </span>
      <span class="lg">
         <span class="l">And many of those who across the plains</span>

         <span class="l indent">The Overland Coach moved on</span>
         <span class="l">With its living freight, and its treasures great,</span>
