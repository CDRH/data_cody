      <p>Wired you to contract east end immediately get work started. Write each stock holder <u>fully</u>— telling them what the money will be used for— then later the contract can be let for upper end— You have <del>r</del> dried lumber for flumes long ago as we talked that over— the timber &amp; lumber must be gotten this fall ready— Assess each of us to do the east end &amp; pay contractors now then later make another assessment for upper end—</p>

      <p>How does the prospects look for the Governorship<a href="../doc/n03" class="internal_link">3</a>?</p>
