      <span class="salute">Dear Col Brennan,</span>



      <p>Pardon me for forgetting to send the $1.00 for the telegram.</p>

      <p>We are getting along nicely. These Brules haven't the snap and get up that the Ogalallas have but they do fairly well. And they work for <span class="unclear ">[about?]</span>  half the wages. We paid the Ogalallas <span class="unclear ">[which?]</span> amounts to a big lot of money on the seasons.</p>

      <p>Please remember me to Iron Tail or any of my red brothers.</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">With my very kindest regards to your self,</span>
         <span class="salute">
            <span class="unclear ">[I am?]</span>
yours truly,</span>
         <br/>W. F. Cody
