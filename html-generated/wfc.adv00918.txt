                <p>In the Bad Lands of the Dakotas, where the Indian wars of the early West were fought, is the scene of the reaction of those same battles in Essanay's feature "Adventures of Buffalo Bill." Col. Cody and Lieutenant-General Nelson A. Miles, as well as other United States army generals, appear in this thrilling photodrama.</p>
                
                <p>"Adventures of Buffalo Bill" is a big moving lesson in Americanism — something in which the sons and daughters of today and their children of tomorrow, may view the heroism of their forefathers and the noble sacrifices which were made to give them their present-day peace and prosperity.</p>
