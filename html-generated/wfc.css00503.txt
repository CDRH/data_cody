   <div class="note">Note 1: The year is not inscribed by Cody but is 1896: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performance in La Crosse, Wisconsin, on September 7, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "La Crosse, Wis. / Monday, Sept. 7. Everything was put up early this morning. All extra seat stuff was forwarded to Minneapolis to await our arrival there next Sunday. Mr. Gardner, of the advance, gave us a call this afternoon. Supt. James P. Anderson stepped off the depot platform to-night and fell into a pile of railroad iron; he will be seen around the camp as a ruin for a few days. Col. Cody was the recipient of a beautiful bouquet of flowers this afternoon from the wife of his old friend, Dr. Frank Powell. / Business big at both performances. / Weather clear and cold. / Lot, State street. / Arena, 188 x 406."</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: "Women" refers to the new postmistress of the town, Mrs. Marion Williams, who filed for a new Post Office under the name of "Shoshone," but the name was rejected by the government because of confusion with Shoshone Agency established in 1870 (in 1937 that name was changed to the Wind River Agency). Mrs. Williams submitted the name "Richland" for the town; the Post Office accepted this name. However, a meeting was called by important members of the town, and the new name of "Cody" was formally submitted. The government then cancelled the name 'Richland' and in August 1896 formally accepted the name Cody, Wyoming.</div>
