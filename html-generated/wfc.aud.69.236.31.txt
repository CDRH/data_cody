Gertrude KÃ¤sebier's photograph of Has No Horses and High Heron is one of a few where she puts groups together; couples or one or more Indians together in an artistic portrait. She is the foremost portraitist in America at the time and the way that she works with positioning the individuals in front of the camera, potentially directing them in where to gaze and how to hold still as she's making this image. And also thinking about how they dress themselves, whether she coordinated that, because we know that the Sioux Indians brought to her studio a mix of the best of the clothing that they had amongst the troupe traveling with the show in 1898. It's a very contemplative piece, a very serious work, and just one of the styles that she took as a formal artistic portrait.</p>
