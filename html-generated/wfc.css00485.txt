      <p>I have asked for a statement several times for the work my teams have done. <u>You</u> could give that— Flood— I am <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="informed​ ">imformed</a>
    ​ That my stock is being cruelly treated if so I blame <u>you</u> for that. I understand that they have been over worked all day long pulled to death without water then tied

up all night long without water. If this is so— there is not words strong enough in any language to express my feelings— And if I find out that this is true Some one will be called down and left out for it. Any man who cruelly treats a dumb brute Is not fit to live. <span class="persName">Frank Grouard</span> has my stock in charge and what he says about them goes— There will be some rapid changes if I<del>f</del> find my poor dumb brutes are being cruelly treated

I will stand most anything else but that—</p>

      <p>I know what you have to contend with and I might say all alone— And I often feel for you— And <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="believe​ ">beleive</a>

   <div class="note">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in St. Louis, Missouri, May 18-23, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "St. Louis, Mo. / Friday, May 22. To-day the weather cleared up a little and gave one good day, consequently good business; every chair in the house was sold at 7.30. Col. Cody's horse fell this afternoon and caught his foot, but did him no injury. Cowboys Bill Brace and Bob Wilkinson were thrown to-night in the bucking-horse act. The Order of the Mystic Shrine came out in a body to see us to-night."</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: "Mr. Flood" is likely "D. P. Flood" who wrote to Beck in 1896 and is mentioned by Cody in 1896 letters to Beck. Flood may have been a foreman or livestock handler employed on the irrigation project; his exact role is not known.</div>
