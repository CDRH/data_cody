         <p>
            <span class="persName">Red Shirt</span> (Ogalasa), a Chief of the Sioux, was then presented, and the Queen expressed her pleasure at seeing him. Red Shirt replied that it made him glad to hear her. He had come a long way to see Her Majesty. From his great chief, <span class="persName">Sitting Bull</span>, he had heard of the Great Mother, but had never expected to see her. He was glad to the squaw who was more powerful than any man.</p>

         <p>The Queen expressed a desire to see the Indian babies or papoosses. Two of these were presented for Her Majesty's inspection, and she was pleased to shake their little hands and pat their chubby, painted cheeks.</p>
