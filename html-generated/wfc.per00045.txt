      <h3>To Put Out "Buffalo Bill" Film</h3>
      <h3>
         <strong>It Was Made by Essanay and Will Be Distributed by K-E-S-E.</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>"BUFFALO BILL," whose death in Denver was announced Wednesday, January 10, was a warm friend of George K. Spoor, president of the Essanay Film Manufacturing Company, Chicago, and through him arranged to leave his autobiography in film to posterity.  It is probably the first instance of the film being used for this purpose.</p>
      <p>"The Life of Buffalo Bill" and the Indian wars was produced under the auspices of the United States Government as an historical record of the forming of the West.  William F. Cody (Buffalo Bill), the greatest plainsman of them all, and the most romantic figure in the building of the nation, is shown throughout his life and battles.  "Buffalo Bill' himself plays the leading role.</p>
      <p>This picture, which is to be distributed throughout the United States by the Kleine-Edison-Selig-Essanay service, shows myriads of Indians, regiments of United States soldiers and scores of picturesque scouts, many of them boon companions of Buffalo Bill, each in some thrilling feature.  Most of the veteran scouts of the West were asked by Buffalo Bill to contribute something to his film autobiography and the result is said to be decidedly interesting.</p>
      <p>As it stands and will be shown on the screens throughout the United States, "The Life of Buffalo Bill" is an hour and ten minutes of thrilling action, terrifying Indian battles and prairie skirmishes, its exciting moments contrasting with its acute pathos, its light, amusing situations fitting in consistently with the daring and dangerous humor of the grim frontiersmen.</p>
