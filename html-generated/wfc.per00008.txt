      <p>Oh! Blow it! Twenty-four years have passed since I saw Colonel Cody and his troupe in London. Life was sweet, then, at two and twenty! The Colonel was the rage of London. And after this long span of years, I find him still the rage of America, beloved by young and old, especially the young. I am pleased to learn that the Colonel and his troupe have been filmed by my friend Craft. Three reels of the Buffalo Bill-Pawnee Bill Wild West shows, with Indians, cowboys, cowgirls, Mexicans, Cossacks and hundreds of horsemen in their great riding exhibitions, are to be shown on the moving picture screen. State rights for these films are available and I hope they will be taken up all over the country for a long time to come. </p>
