         <em class="hi">BUFFALO BILL'S NEAR FAREWELL.</em>
      </h3>
      <p>Since it has become generally known that the season of the Wild West in the Madison-Square Garden must be brought to a close very soon the crowds in the building have been enormous. Popular interest in the great exhibition is apparently as lively as ever. Eight days only remain of the season, making a stay in this city altogether of 13 weeks, a marvelous showing. Buffalo Bill and his partner, <span class="persName">Nate Salsbury</span>, have completed all their arrangements for the departure for England. They have made, during the Winter and last Summer on Staten Island, a great deal of money, but they are led to think that twice as much awaits them over the ocean. The <span class="persName">Queen</span> has already signified her intention of gracing the initial performance in London, <span class="persName">Henry Irving</span> having successfully negotiated in that direction. The performances on the other side will be given precisely the same as they were given last Summer, no scenery being used.</p>
