                    <p>Col. W. F. Cody has never performed a more important service for the government than in the supervision of the making of a large collection of films picturing the early history of the Western plains. He has been engaged since his Wild West show closed in Denver in making moving pictures of battle scenes and historical incidents in various parts of the plains and the Rocky mountain region. In this work he has been provided with an abundance of help and has been able therefore to reproduce with Indians, soldiers and cowboys the most stirring events of past years in their correct historical setting. Col. Cody has now taken the complete films to Washington for delivery to the government. After being shown to a select company of people in one of the theaters, they will be filed in the archives of the war and interior departments for the benefit of posterity. The moving picture firms would pay handsomely for these films, but they are not for sale. They constitute an accurate record of the development of the West, and especially of the advance of the Indian from his savage state to his present near approach to citizenship.</p>
