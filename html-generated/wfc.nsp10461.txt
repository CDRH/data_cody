      <h3>The National Defenses</h3>

      <span class="gap sampling">[sampling]</span>

      <p>The London Times celebrated its 100th birthday last Sunday. Of late the Times has shown the effects of age. Only a few weeks ago it solemnly declared that the presence of Buffalo Bill and his wild west show in England had done more than anything else to cement cordial relations between the United States and Great Britain. Buffalo Bill has many admirers in that country, but those best acquainted with him are not prepared to believe that he is a great diplomatist. Furthermore, what will Boston think of this snub direct to her first citizen<a name="n01.ref"> </a>

He was a prominent figure in Boston public life for much of his career. Serving as President Lincoln's foreign minister in Britain during the American Civil War, he helped preserve British neutrality in the face of Confederate efforts to gain official recognition.<a href="#n01.ref"> [back]</a>
