      <span class="persName">Mr. Bronson Rumsey</span>,

680 Ellicott Square, 

Buffalo, New York.


<span class="salute">Dear Sir:</span>


      <p>Herewith the usual semi-annual statement, covering the transactions had with respect to the property at Cody, held jointly by yourself, as trustee, and this company, for the period ending June 30 last, showing a balance of $362.61  due this company, since which time we have paid an additional water assessment of $320.00.</p>

      <p>The item of $500.00, "County Division Matters", represents the amount of subscription to the fund to aid in procuring the division if Big Horn county and the locating of Cody as the county seat of the new Park county.</p>

      <p>You will note that business up there has been mighty quiet. Quite a number of people up there were knocked pretty hard by the failure of the big irrigation company opening up Oregon Basin.</p>


      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Very truly,</span>

         <br/>ABMinor<br/>

Secy.
