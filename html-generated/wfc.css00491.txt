My Dear <span class="persName">Beck</span>—

<p>I dont know whether I am doing this right or not or whether you can understand it. So I want you to answer me at once and let me know. If I am wrong I will correct it. Annother thing I fear without you have a good functional reliable man to handle the sales of water rights Lots &amp;c— Our co sooner or later will have trouble on their hands that they cannot say <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="let's​ ">lets</a>
    ​ pocket the losses and let it go. But it will involve not only our company into endless trouble but the purchaser and the state, and <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="finally​ ">finaly</a>
    ​ the government— So I wish you would please let me know who has charge of this department.</p>

      <p>Now as <u>
            <span class="persName">Alger</span>
         </u> is in the Basin— I send you $500 payable to him. Now please be careful and understand &amp; make no mistake

   <div class="note">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Springfield, Ohio, on July 7, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "Springfield, Ohio. / Tuesday, July 7. Arrived in town at 5 A. M. Two-mile haul to lot. If ever Anderson prayed for still weather he did to-day. We could not get a stake down over twelve inches anywhere and the least wind would have blown us down, but with our usual good luck we came out all right. Refreigo Carrello, a Mexican, was thrown in the grand entree to-day; his left shoulder was badly hurt and sprained and he received a lot of small bruises and was badly used up. Master-Mechanic Dan Taylor left to-day for Columbus, Ohio, to get the grounds ready for our next Monday's engagement. / Business at both performances good. / Lot, Columbus and Isabell streets. / Arena, 182 x 368."</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: "Sweeney" is William Sweeney (1856-1917), a cornet player who organized and directed the Cowboy Band in Buffalo Bill's Wild West, remaining with Buffalo Bill's Wild West from 1883 to 1913.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 3: "Berch" is George Burch who was Chief of Cowboys for Buffalo Bill's Wild West in 1896 and later. </div>

   <div class="note">Note 4: "William Snyder" is William "Okie" Snyder (b.1856), one of Cody's men and a cowboy in Buffalo Bill's Wild West during 1896. </div>

   <div class="note">Note 5: "M. F. Polhamus" is not fully identified but was likely also a member of Buffalo Bill's Wild West.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 6: Edward R. Goodman was the agent for the members of Buffalo Bill's Wild West for whom Cody was reserving land parcels.</div>
