                <p>The "Moving Picture World" says:</p>
                <p>"Buffalo Bill" is a name to conjure with amongst the youth of the land.  The very name on the poster at the theatre door would mean a full house.  For nearly fifty years Col. Cody has been before the public eye, so that when the pictures of his farewell round-ups are announced, not only the youth but the boys of fifty will want to see them.</p>
                <p>The "Bill Board" says:</p>
                <p>"Never before in all film history has such a hit been made as with the Buffalo Bill Wild West — Pawnee Bill Far East pictures.  Exchanges and moving picture men the country over are enthusiastic over the films, which from a standpoint of photography have seldom been equaled.</p>
                <p>The "Clipper" says:</p>
                <p>"Every scene has been photographed, and every scene is as lifelike as if you joined the sweltering crowd and jammed your way into the sweltering tent on the road."</p>
