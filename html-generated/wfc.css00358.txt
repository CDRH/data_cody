      <span class="salute">Dear Mr. Holdrege:</span>


      <p>I enclose herewith copy of a letter received to-day from Col. Cody, and also copy of my answer, of this date.</p>

      <p>I think it desirable, when you know just what we want in the way of station grounds at Cody, or elsewhere to ask them to give us deeds; and, now that Col. Cody has promised co-operation, and said we can have everything he can give us, no doubt the officers of the Company will execute the necessary papers, when the time comes.</p>

      <div class="note">(Enc.)</div>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours truly, </span>
         <br/>C. E. Perkins


Mr. G. W. Holdrege
Gen'l Manager, Omaha.
