      <p>Your favor of May 19<u>th</u> Is the most satisfactory letter I ever recd from you. But its not quite up to the Mark— As you seem to avoid what we at this end want to know and have asked time and again. We want you to list all the outside debts you have contracted And what you propose doing. As it is you contract debts and will neither give <span class="persName">Alger</span> or any one else any warning of what you do— As I learn you do not keep a record of them your self of course its hard for you to remember them. I understand you keep no record of the land or Town<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> lots you dispose of

and very soon you will have our company in an <del>af</del> awful mix up We are aware that every thing at that end is run like a widow woman farm.

      <p>George— I am speaking plain. I am getting the blame for this kind of management and I propose to land the blame where it belongs I am sick and tired of nonsense— and will stand it no longer— Business has got to be done on business principles or as the others say. I will say my self I will not put up another dollar and give my reasons for so doing. I was in hopes you would quit nonsense and get down to business—</p>
