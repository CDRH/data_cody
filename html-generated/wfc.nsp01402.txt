      <h3>Buffalo Bill's Wild West Indians.</h3>

      <p>The condition and complaints of ill-treatment made by the Indians who have recently returned from Buffalo Bill's and other Wild West shows now in Europe has been set forth in a letter sent by Gen. James O'Beirne to Thomas J. Morgan, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, at Washington. General O'Beirne points out the violation of the contracts made by Cody and other managers, and suggests that an investigation be made by the United States authorities.</p>
