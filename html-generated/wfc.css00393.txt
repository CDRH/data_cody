   <div class="note">Note 1: Although Cody did not include the year when dating this letter, the context indicates that it was written in 1914. Cody went to Washington, D.C. in February 1914 to show his film <em class="hi">The Indian Wars</em> to audiences that included senior officials in the Interior and War Departments.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: "Johnny" is <span class="persName">Lewis H. "Johnny" Baker</span> (1869-1931).</div>

   <div class="note">Note 3: <a href="../doc/texts/wfc.css00389" class="internal_link">A letter</a> from Cody to Tait, dated simply "Jan. 22" but believed to be written in 1914, apparently refers to Baker sending images of "the Mexican Army &amp; Refugees" to Cody who describes Baker's material as "great stuff."</div>
