<span class="salute">My Dear Major—</span>

      <p>I am sending six Indians home to day. Not but what they are good men. but four of them are not fit for duty, and two of them claim their families are sick. These men all wanted to go home so I let them go— I hope it will be satisfactory to you—</p>
