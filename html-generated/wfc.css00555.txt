In 1896 on a hunt in the Big Horn Basin, Painter fell in love with Sunlight Basin (north of Cody and south of the Beartooth Mountains). Painter sold his business, transported himself and his family from Philadelphia, and became a mining man, establishing the Sunlight Copper Mining Company, which contained copper, silver, and gold ores. <a href="#n03.ref"> [back]</a>
