Major John R. Brennen.
Pine Ridge Agency, S. D.


<span class="salute">My Dear Major <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Brennan​ ">Brennen</a>
    ​:—</span>

  
      <p>Ghost Dog<a href="../doc/n01" class="internal_link">1</a> who has been with my Company for several years has returned to the Agency, having been summoned there by his family who I understand have been in poor health. I want to tell you that Ghost Dog has been a good man while in my employ and I am glad to recommend him to all as such. I had John Long Bull examined by a very able physician in Omaha and am sorry to say he is suffering from consumption.<a href="../doc/n02" class="internal_link">2</a> I had him sent home where I hope the air will be more agreeable to his complaint.</p>

      <p>I also wish to let you know that Bad Cob<a href="../doc/n03" class="internal_link">3</a> with his wife and boy, also Alfred Black Bear<a href="../doc/n04" class="internal_link">4</a> and Takes Away From Them <a href="../doc/n05" class="internal_link">5</a> left us at Sioux City Iowa on August 27th without my consent or knowledge, and that Red Bear <a href="../doc/n06" class="internal_link">6</a> deserted at Omaha, thereby breaking their contract with me. I mention these facts simply that you may know them.</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">With kindest regards, I am yours truly</span>
