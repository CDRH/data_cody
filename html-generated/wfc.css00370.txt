      <span class="salute">Dear Sir,â€”</span>

      <p>I have received this morning a letter from a man by the name of Sutherlin, from Helena, Montana, stating that the Northern Pacific has arranged with the Montana Railroad Company to extend its line east and south to a connection with their line at Forsythe, 102 miles east of Billings.  He has obtained this information from Mr. J. C. Morris, Superintendent of the Montana Railroad Company, who wrote to you about employment, and from some other sources.  This road will occupy the Musselshell Valley for quite a distance, either upon or adjacent to our surveys.  If this should be done it indicates that the Northern Pacific road is preparing by extensions and branches to look after local territory in Montana, as well as in Idaho, where they have done a large amount of work lately.  This emphasizes to my mind the importance of prompt action upon our part in taking possession of the Big Horn Basin country, in accordance with my previous suggestions.</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Your respectfully,</span>
         <br/>G. W. Holdrege


Mr. C. E. Perkins,
Pres't, Ludell, Kas.
