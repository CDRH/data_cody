         <a name="n03.note"> </a>Note 3: A Lakota man known as William Brown was one of the leaders of a hunting and berry-gathering party that was accosted by a sheriff's posse north of Lusk, Wyoming, in October 1903, and accused of violating game laws.  Shots were fired, and several Indians, as well as the sheriff and one of his posse, were killed.  The Office of Indian Affairs cited "hasty and imprudent conduct" by the sheriff as the incident's cause.  A graduate of Carlisle Indian School, Brown was one of several Lakota men who met with the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in 1908 to ask for more economic opportunities for residents of the Pine Ridge Reservation.<a href="#n03.ref"> [back]</a>
