<span class="salute">Dear Sir</span>

      <p>Can you tell me how many acres of land is included in the Cody Townsite, &amp; number of acres adjoining the Town now being managed by the Lincoln Land Co. How much has been paid to you as trustee for the 7 owners of the 1/2 interest, &amp; how much, if any, is now in your hands as trustee?</p>

      <p>I wish to get some idea of the extent of this property, and the value of the interest held by <span class="persName">Mr. Alger.</span> Is there any incumbrance, or condition , of any kind, attaching to Mr. Alger's interest, and how is this interest evidenced?</p>

      <p>In your judgment what is the value of the 1/7 of 1/2 interest owned by the Alger Estate?</p>

      <p>Thanking you for your trouble, and assistance in this matter.</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">I am Very Truly Yours</span>

         <br/>B. F. Perkins
