      <h3>BUFFALO BILL</h3>
        
        <p>By Walt Mason.</p>
        
        <p>(Copyright 1912 By George Matthew Adams.)</p>
        
        <p>They've taken down the great gray tents, the Injuns and imported gents who lately robbed the Deadwood bus are on their uppers now, or wuss; where late rough rode and swore <span class="unclear ">[...?]</span> bucking bronchos buck no more. Bill's stunt is done and we shall know his face no more in tented show. Alas, that in his wintry years, disaster in his path appears! Of pioneers about the last, he links the present to the past. Before our thrifty cities rose, he tracked and fought the settlers' foes, and showed the path, o'er lonely plains, to long and creaking wagon trains; both guide and guard, he led the van, in war or peace a mighty man. With big, brave heart and noble face, a form with tiger's strength and grace, a soul as true as was his aim, and mind as broad as was his fame, of all the heroes of the West, Bill Cody is beloved the best. Oh, hero of our boyhood days! Oh, Bayard of the frontier ways! The world grows sordid in pursuit of stocks and bonds and other loot; and all we hear along the pike is talk of mergers and the like; and you bring back a wholesome thought of things too apt to be forgot; of daytime treks and night alarms and stalwart men's appeals to arms, of men who gave their blood to buy the land whereon our mansions lie, of vistas fresh and great and still — and so God bless you, Buffalo Bill!</p>
