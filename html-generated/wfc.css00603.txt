      <p>In compliance with your instructions of this morning, I called to see the Acting Private Secretary to the Secretary of War relative to certain reels or films, mentioned in connection with letter dated the 27th instant from Colonel W. F. Cody, and was informed that a messenger from the War Department called at the Willard Hotel and obtained from Colonel Cody, personally, a box containing six films (four made by Colonel Cody, and two others to be shown in connection therewith); it was understood that these films were for the War Department; there were no duplicates, and the set of films are now at the War College.</p>
