   <div class="note">Note 1: The land segregation Cody refers to in this letter was intended for the Cody-Salsbury Canal project. A report published in the Cheyenne Leader on November 29, 1903, and reprinted in the Cody Enterprise on December 3 states that Cody would soon go east to seek English and American investors for the Cody-Salsbury Canal. If these reports are accurate, this was apparently Cody's last attempt to secure private financing for the project. Cody turned over his interest in the Cody-Salsbury segregation to the federal government in February 1904. Fenimore Chatterton (1860-1958) was then acting governor of Wyoming.</div>

   <div class="note">Note 2: Thomas T. Tynan (1860-1925), was Wyoming's superintendent of public instruction and a member of the Board of Land Commissioners from 1899 to 1907. Tynan later served as mayor of Sheridan, Wyoming, from 1914 to 1915. "Johnson" is probably a reference to Clarence T. Johnston (1872-1970), who served as Wyoming state engineer from 1903 to 1911.</div>
