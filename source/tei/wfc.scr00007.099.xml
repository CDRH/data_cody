<head>THE GUN CLUB.</head>

<p>VISITORS mustered in force on Saturday, the company present
including a large number of ladies, an extra attraction being <persName xml:id="oakley.a">Miss
Annie Oakley</persName>, of the Wild West Show, who gave her private
exhibition of gun and rifle-shooting, which was the same as that
recently performed before <persName xml:id="victoria.q">her Majesty</persName> and the <persName xml:id="albert.edward">Prince</persName> and
<persName xml:id="alexandra.denmark">Princess of Wales</persName>, with the addition that, after doing wonders
with the rifle at glass balls and clay pigeons, Miss Oakley concluded her performance with a trial at twenty-five blue rocks,
from the regulation five traps, at 23yds, rise. There was much
applause at her skill, and certainly there were, amongst the
company, many good judges of shooting. Of the twenty-five
rocks, she brought down eighteen, some being long shots. On
the termination of the performance, the president, Viscount
Stormont, on behalf of the club, presented her with a gold medal
commemorative of the event, and said how gratified those
present were, and trusted she might long live to wear it.
In reply, Miss Oakley said she had travelled through many
countries, and had reveived much kindness and courtesy, but
never more than in England. She thanked the President, committee, and members of the Gun Club for the reception they
had given her, and also for the handsome medal his Lordship
had just handed to her, which she should certainly wear with
very much pleasure.</p>
