<head type="main">A PEEP AT BUFFALO BILL'S WILD WEST.</head>

<lg>
<lg>
<l>To lasso the Buffalo on the plains,</l>
<l rend="indent">To drive the wolf from its lair,</l>
<l>To run and race at break-neck pace,</l>
<l rend="indent">To shoot at the hungry bear,</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Away from the haunts of men to go</l>
<l rend="indent">And follow his own sweet will,</l>
<l>O this was the sort of life, and the sport</l>
<l rend="indent">That suited Buffalo Bill!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>The whole Wild West was open to him;</l>
<l rend="indent">And there he could freely roam,</l>
<l>And under the trees could live at his ease,</l>
<l rend="indent">And make himself quite at home.</l>
</lg>


<lg>
<l>The dream of his boyhood it had been</l>
<l rend="indent">To live in the wild-wood free</l>
<l>Like a pioneer, and to chase the deer</l>
<l rend="indent">With others as wild as he.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>So steady his hand and so sure his aim</l>
<l rend="indent">As he flung out the light lasso,</l>
<l>That in the loop of his line he'd scoop</l>
<l rend="indent">The terrible Buffalo.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>The ways of the wild-ox well he learned&#8212;</l>
<l rend="indent">And such was his nerve and skill</l>
<l>In snaring this game, that he won great fame,</l>
<l rend="indent">And the name of Buffalo Bill.</l>
</lg>

</lg>

<lg>
<l>But out in the land of the setting sun,</l>
<l rend="indent">The savages made their home,</l>
<l>And in search of food o'er mountain and wood</l>
<l rend="indent">The red men were wont to roam.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And oft they would cross the great frontier</l>
<l rend="indent">The white men to rob and slay,</l>
<l>And troops were sent by the government</l>
<l rend="indent">To keep the wretches at bay.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Swiftly the arrows rushed through the air,</l>
<l rend="indent">Loudly the guns replied;</l>
<l>And red and white took part in the fight</l>
<l rend="indent">And the dead were on either side.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The savages knew every inch of the ground,</l>
<l rend="indent">Very crafty were they and sly,</l>
<l>And with loosened rein o'er the level plain</l>
<l rend="indent">With wonderful speed did they fly.</l>
</lg>
<lg>

<l>O brave and bold must the white man be</l>
<l rend="indent">Who follows the red man's track,</l>
<l>By day and night prepared to fight</l>
<l rend="indent">And parry the fierce attack.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>With eye as keen as an eagle's own, </l>
<l rend="indent">With a steady hand and nerve</l>
<l>He must stand in his place, and the foeman face,</l>
<l rend="indent">And never from duty swerve.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The troops press on with a steady march,</l>
<l rend="indent">With pistols and guns supplied;</l>
<l>But as brave as they are they cannot go far</l>
<l rend="indent">Without a reliable guide;</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And happy are they in meeting with one</l>
<l rend="indent">So worthy this post to fill,</l>
<l>For there couldn't be found in the country around</l>
<l rend="indent">Such a scout as Buffalo Bill.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>He knew where their wigwams were set up,</l>
<l rend="indent">And once he had led a raid</l>
<l>Right into the camp of a tattoed scamp,</l>
<l rend="indent">Who had reason to be afraid</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Of a white man's wrath; for his hands were dyed</l>
<l rend="indent">With blood, and much pride he felt</l>
<l>In having a gun he had seized from one</l>
<l rend="indent">Whose scalp he wore at his belt.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>By all the Sioux and the bold Cheyennes</l>
<l rend="indent">Apaches and Nez Perc&#233;s,</l>
<l>Was the scout well known, and he had grown</l>
<l rend="indent">Familiar with all their ways.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>He had seen them oft in bloodthirsty mood, </l>
<l rend="indent">With feathery shield and lance,</l>
<l>With their war-paint on, and the scalps they'd won,</l>
<l rend="indent">Indulge in a wild, war dance.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The fagots were lit, and around and around</l>
<l rend="indent">In a ring the savages went,</l>
<l>While the horrid drum, with its tum-a-tum-tum,</l>
<l rend="indent">With their shouts and their war-whoops blent.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And there on the embers they meant to lay</l>
<l rend="indent">The prisoner lately caught,</l>
<l>So cruel were they, and this was the way</l>
<l rend="indent">To treat their foes they were taught.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And many of those who across the plains</l>
<l rend="indent">To the aid of the red men had come,</l>
<l>Had abused them well&#8212;'tis a shame to tell&#8212;</l>
<l rend="indent">And increased their thirst for rum.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And the old feuds grew, and the red men claimed</l>
<l rend="indent">The land they had long possessed;</l>
<l>And the white men fought for the prize they sought</l>
<l rend="indent">A home in the Wild, Wild West.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>O'er dangerous roads, and through canyons deep</l>
<l rend="indent">The Overland Coach moved on</l>
<l>With its living freight, and its treasures great,</l>
<l rend="indent">In charge of the driver, John.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>O wonderful stories he had to tell</l>
<l rend="indent">Of the dangers that he had met,</l>
<l>For on many a trip he had cracked his whip,</l>
<l rend="indent">And never once been upset.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But out of the shadows would bandits steal&#8212;</l>
<l rend="indent">Those masked and merciless bands&#8212;</l>
<l>And the stage-coach stop, and their pistols pop,</l>
<l rend="indent">Till the passengers raised their hands.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And then their money these rogues would take,</l>
<l rend="indent">Their watches and chains without fail,</l>
<l>And empty each bag of the precious "swag"</l>
<l rend="indent">That was part of the Overland mail.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And then if the white rogues they escaped</l>
<l rend="indent">The red men were sure to come</l>
<l>With arrows and bows, and their way oppose,</l>
<l rend="indent">And prove very troublesome.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And to keep themselves in good fighting trim,</l>
<l rend="indent">And worthy a warrior's place,</l>
<l>Each youthful brave by his sire so grave</l>
<l rend="indent">Was compelled to run a race.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And Hole-in-the-ground, and Rain-in-the-face,</l>
<l rend="indent">In their moccasons did appear,</l>
<l>With Stick-in-the-mud, and Big-young blood</l>
<l rend="indent">And Dare-devil in the rear.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And as swift as the nimble-footed deer</l>
<l rend="indent">Away o'er the course they sped,</l>
<l>And Rain-in-the-face kept up his pace,</l>
<l rend="indent">And always came out ahead.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>Still the settlers manage to push their way</l>
<l rend="indent">Along through the Wild, Wild West,</l>
<l>And the weary length of the road their strength</l>
<l rend="indent">Is daily put to the test.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And to keep them safe from the savage beasts</l>
<l rend="indent">That growl and threaten to kill,</l>
<l>And from Indian bands that infest the lands,</l>
<l rend="indent">They are guarded by Buffalo Bill.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And he and his men are on the alert</l>
<l rend="indent">These enemies fierce to spy,</l>
<l>And if one of them shows the tip of his nose,</l>
<l rend="indent">Ah me! how the bullets fly!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And through many perils the settlers reach</l>
<l rend="indent">The spot that they think the best,</l>
<l>And a space is cleared, and a house is reared&#8212;</l>
<l rend="indent">A modest but sweet home-nest.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And driven away by the white man's axe</l>
<l rend="indent">From the early haunts of his race,</l>
<l>The Indian packs his tents, and makes tracks</l>
<l rend="indent">For a suitable dwelling-place.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The squaws and papooses ride on ahead</l>
<l rend="indent">With blankets around them twined,</l>
<l>With their houses all rolled up in a ball</l>
<l rend="indent">And the tent-poles trailing behind.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And the little boys that are early trained</l>
<l rend="indent">To hunt for the forest game,</l>
<l>With arrow and bow look out for the foe</l>
<l rend="indent">And are very sure in their aim.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And this is the game of hide-and-seek</l>
<l rend="indent">The white men and red men play</l>
<l>On the prairies wide, where on every side</l>
<l rend="indent">They fight for the right of way.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>The Indian village again set up,</l>
<l rend="indent">The Squaws must remain at home</l>
<l>With the younger brood, to prepare the food,</l>
<l rend="indent">While the warriors further roam.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And girt with the weapons that they have won</l>
<l rend="indent">From enemies they have slain,</l>
<l>They watch and wait both early and late</l>
<l rend="indent">The approach of the settlers train.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And Buffalo Bill, who knows their ways,</l>
<l rend="indent">And the evil that they would do,</l>
<l>Puts foot to horse, and soon comes across</l>
<l rend="indent">The track of the sneaking Sioux.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And lucky for him if the band is small</l>
<l rend="indent">And the weapons they hold but few,</l>
<l>For he and his men may easily then </l>
<l rend="indent">Disperse the blood-thirsty crew.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The Indian mother is proud of her boys,</l>
<l rend="indent">And will urge them to be as bold</l>
<l>And brave as their sire, whom they admire,</l>
<l rend="indent">Of whose deeds they are daily told.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And the wild young savages run and leap,</l>
<l rend="indent">And keep all their limbs in play,</l>
<l>Their lithe forms lave in the sparkling wave,</l>
<l rend="indent">And the laws of their tribe obey.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>While the Indian maiden, with raven hair,</l>
<l rend="indent">Performs her duties apart</l>
<l>With a touch of grace, and a smile on her face,</l>
<l rend="indent">And a sweet little dream in her heart.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And though some in the red men's homes may long</l>
<l rend="indent">For wars that will never cease,</l>
<l>There are others we know who would gladly go</l>
<l rend="indent">With the white men, and be at peace.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>The scouts and the settlers soon make friends,</l>
<l rend="indent">And in company, side by side,</l>
<l>At a pace not slow away they go,</l>
<l rend="indent">And over the prairies ride.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The wild-woods ring with their merry songs,</l>
<l rend="indent">And happy as they can be</l>
<l>Are the girls and boys, for each enjoys</l>
<l rend="indent">A home in the wild-woods free.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And in fun and frolic they all delight,</l>
<l rend="indent">And practice their steeds with skill,</l>
<l>And with wondrous grace they take their place</l>
<l rend="indent">And their part in a gay quadrille.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Now right and left, and forward and back,</l>
<l rend="indent">And around in a ring they go;</l>
<l>Then ladies chain, and back again,</l>
<l rend="indent">And promenade in a row.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>O Buffalo Bill like a spirit rides</l>
<l rend="indent">And dashes across the plain;</l>
<l>His wonderful steed to his voice gives heed </l>
<l rend="indent">And answers the touch of the rein.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And swiftly the light lasso is flung,</l>
<l rend="indent">And seldom is it at fault,</l>
<l>For it stops the speed of the flying steed,</l>
<l rend="indent">That's brought to a sudden halt.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And to tame them and train them for future use</l>
<l rend="indent">Is a joy to Buffalo Bill,</l>
<l>And the cow-boys and he are as fond as can be</l>
<l rend="indent">Of the sport that demands such skill.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And almost human the beasts become,</l>
<l rend="indent">And though under control of reins</l>
<l>They are almost as free as they used to be </l>
<l rend="indent">When roaming wild o'er the plains.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>At home in the saddle the young folks are</l>
<l rend="indent">From morn until late at night,</l>
<l>And the girls and the boys make all the noise</l>
<l rend="indent">They can their steeds to affright.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>They fire their muskets; shattering stones</l>
<l rend="indent">That are thrown aloft in the air;</l>
<l>And are equally deft with right hand or left,</l>
<l rend="indent">In touching the target there.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And away with a swift and a steady pace,</l>
<l rend="indent">Like birds with their wide-spread wings,</l>
<l>The good steeds go, and their rider's glow</l>
<l rend="indent">With the health that such pastime brings.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And one who is more expert than the rest,</l>
<l rend="indent">The brave and the fearless Madge,</l>
<l>For the skill displayed, and the records made,</l>
<l rend="indent">Is worthy a marksman's badge.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And Buckskin Joe, and Hurricane Dick,</l>
<l rend="indent">Regard her doings with pride,</l>
<l>For to them she owes whatever she knows;</l>
<l rend="indent">They taught her to shoot and to ride.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Some horses there are that a man can trust,</l>
<l rend="indent">But oh! it requires great pluck,</l>
<l>It does, indeed, to manage a steed</l>
<l rend="indent">That is always disposed to "buck."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Then there's a fight between horse and man,</l>
<l rend="indent">And the strength of the will is shown;</l>
<l>And sometimes, alas! it comes to pass</l>
<l rend="indent">That the rider is finally thrown.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And all these doings recorded here</l>
<l rend="indent">In the haunts of the Buffalo,</l>
<l>Where the cowboys dwell, and the Indians yell,</l>
<l rend="indent">Are part of the WILD WEST SHOW.</l>
