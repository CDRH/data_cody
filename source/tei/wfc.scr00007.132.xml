<head>THE AMERICAN FIELD</head>

<head>NOTES.</head>

<p>MISS ANNIE OAKLEY'S shooting has caused her popularity to increase rather than diminish with the London public. She gave recently a private performance at Notting Hill, before the members of the Gun Club and a select circle of their friends, with the shotgun and rifle. Shooting at twenty-five Blue Rock pigeons, from five group traps, twenty-five yards rise, using one ounce of shot, she scored eighteen, and two fell dead out of bounds. Referring to the performance the Evening News says: The programme, including several marvelous feats with the rifle and shot-gun, was gone through in fine style, and gave the greatest satisfaction to the many excellent shots who had assembled to witness it. The items which attracted most attention were the breaking of six balls thrown in the air within four seconds, and the breaking of three balls thrown in the air at the same time with a repeating gun. At the end of the regular programme Captain Leighton threw a shilling in the air which Miss Oakley hit with a bullet. Then came the pleasantest part of the day's proceedings, and one that cannot fail to render Miss Oakley's memories of her visit to England very gratifying. The president of the club presented her with an extremely handsome and valuable gold medal, larger than a five-shilling piece. On the obverse was engaved a highly artistic view of the Gun Club's grounds at Notting Hill. The members are seen in the tent, an attendant is springing one of the five pigeon-traps in the foreground, a well-known shot is standing behind with gun leveled, and a number of pigeons are visible in the air. On the clasps of the medal Miss Oakley's name and the date are inscribed, the whole forming a beautiful memento of a good day's sport.</p>
