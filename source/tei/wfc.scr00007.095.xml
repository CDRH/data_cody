MONDAY, JUNE 13.</head>

<head>SHOOTING.<lb/>

THE GUN CLUB, NOTTING HILL.</head>

<p>No finer weather than that experienced on Saturday last could have been desired for the enjoyment of outdoor sports, and the shooting enclosure at this popular club was largely attended, many members being accompanied by ladies. The programme commenced with a contest for the Members' Challenge Cup, value 100 guineas, and on this occasion five members entered into the necessary £25 sweepstakes in connection with the prize. The shooting was not up to the usual average, and after a close struggle between Mr. Kenrick and Mr. Merwyn Watts victory was declared in favour of the former gentleman, who brought down sixteen birds out of twenty, and became the holder of the cup and winner of £125. Mr. Merwyn Watts killed fifteen out of a similar number. The winner used a gun by J. Purdey and Sons, of South Audley street.</p>

<p>As soon as the above event was concluded, Miss Annie Oakley, of the Wild West Show gave an exhibition in shooting, similar in all respects to that given before the public at Kensington. The concluding item in her performance was shooting at twenty-five birds from the 23 yards rise mark, and no fewer than 18 rocks fell to her gun, several being brought down with the second barrel. Miss Oakley was greatly applauded throughout her performance, and at the finish the president of the club presented her with a handsome gold medal. Then followed a £1 handicap sweepstakes (19 subs), and Mr. J. Sutcliffe (29 1/2), Mr. Featherstone (24 1/2), Mr. E. B. Cunliffe (31), and Mr. Herbert (27) dividend after killing 6 birds. The principal event of the afternoon was next proceeded with, viz., an Accumulative Star £1 Handicap Sweepstakes, with a £40 Cup added. A field of thirty-two member came to their marks, and after a long contest Mr. Leraine (31) secured the cup and £180, bringing down twenty-two birds out of twenty-four shot at. Mr. Norfolk (31) and Mr. Featherstone (24 1/2) shared the second and third prizes, amountin to £121. One competitor put over £70 in the pool and unfortunately took nothing out. As it was close upon eight o'clock before the above event was finished, sport concluded with a £2 handicap sweepstakes, with four entries, and this was won by Mr. Hankey (26 1/2) killing four birds. Scores.-</p>
