<head>Kind words for an American Favorite.</head>

<p>Buffalo Bill's Wild West show is meeting with extraordinary success in England. Not only are our English cousins in raptures over the performances given, but the press are lavish in their praise of the performers. The Evening News of London thus speaks of America's champion female shooter, Miss Annie Oakley ([?]) who gave an exhibition of her skill with the shot gun and rifle on the grounds of the Middlesex Gun Club, at Dunellen previous to her departure for England with the Wild West show. The News says:</p>

<p>"The most notable of the many clever and interesting items in Buffalo Bill's programme, were the splendid marksmanship of Miss Annie Oakley, Miss Lilian Smith, and Bill himself, the first-mentioned lady being far and away the best of the three * * * I was also honored with a long and pleasant conversation with Miss Annie Oakley in her tent. This champion shot is as amiable as she is clever, and I don't think that I can pay her a higher compliment than that. Her shooting record is quite phenomenal, and her countrymen are justly proud of her; but all their petting and enthusiasm have failed to spoil her. She is as popular with the other members of the company, of all colors, as her performances have made her with the general public."</p>

<p>The Courier, also of London, publishes a portrait of Miss Oakley, and says:</p>

<p>"Besides her wonderful markmanship, Miss Oakley is an accomplished housewife, as the neat and cheery appearance of her tent on Arapeah Avenue, within the encampment, and those visitors who are fortunate to be invited within cannot but admire the quiet and lady-like manner in which she acts the part of hostess. The Prince of Wales was particularly pleased with, and complimented her most highly, as did also the Queen."</p>
