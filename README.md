## VRA Files

VRA Files must have one of the following in their filenames in order to be populated into one of the 6 visual materials categories: 

1. .pho OR .pht = photographs
2. .pc = postcards
3. .pst = posters
4. .ill = illustrations
5. .va = visual_art
6. .cc = cabinet_cards

(This corresponds to this code: https://github.com/CDRH/data_cody/blob/master/scripts/solr_transform_vra.xsl#L140 a future update could refine this)
