<notesStmt><note>John H. Tait (c1873-1940) was with the 1st U. S. Volunteer Cavalry (Roosevelt Rough Riders) during the Spanish American War May 1- September 30, 1898; Tait is listed as a Roosevelt Rough Rider in the 1899 and 1902 BBWW route books but does not appear in the 1900 route book. Franklin Knight Lane (1864-1921) served as United States Secretary of Interior from 1913 to 1920 under President Woodrow Wilson. Silas "Cy" Compton (1875-1944) was BBWW Chief of Cowboys. Carlo or Carlos Miles (also Myles) was listed as a "Mexican performer" in the 1910-1911 route book; he is listed as a "striker" or attendant of Cody's. Carlo "participated in the historical film by Essanay in 1914" (see Hudson Kensel, Pahaska Tepee, p45). Newspaper articles identify Miles as an "Indian," probably due to his dark skin. In 1913 Carlo was one of the bidders at the bankruptcy auction of BBWW in Denver, Colorado, bidding on Cody's famous horse, Isham. Miles planned to return Isham to Cody as a gift; bidding got to $150 which was more than he could afford. Isham went to Col. Bills from Nebraska, another friend of Cody's, so Isham was returned to Col. Cody who wept with joy.</note></notesStmt>

<note xml:id="n01">Note 1: Although Cody did not include the year in his dateline, this letter can be reliably dated to 1913 based on the stationery used and the references to Cody's plans to shoot motion pictures on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota, which occurred in the fall of 1913.</note>

<note xml:id="n02">Note 2: "John" is almost certainly <persName xml:id="tait.j">John H. Tait</persName>.</note>

<note xml:id="n03">Note 3: Franklin Knight Lane (1864-1921) served as Secretary of the Interior under President Woodrow Wilson from 1913 to 1920. The Office of Indian Affairs, which administered federal Indian policy, was part of the Department of the Interior; thus, Lane had the power to grant William F. Cody access to Pine Ridge for his film project.</note>

<note xml:id="n04">Note 4: All three of the Indian fights Cody mentions here were often depicted in various forms during his career in show business, although Cody himself had been a participant in only two of them. The "Custer Battle" is the Battle of the Little Bighorn, in which Lt. Col. George A. Custer was killed along with five companies of the U.S. Seventh Cavalry on June 25, 1876. The Battle of Summit Springs, fought in northeastern Colorado on July 11, 1869, was the largest battle of Cody's career as a scout with the U.S. Fifth Cavalry. The "Yellow Hand" fight took place in northwestern Nebraska on July 17, 1876.  In this small engagement, Cody killed and scalped a Cheyenne sub-chief whose name is more properly translated as Yellow Hair. The incident contributed to Cody's growing fame within months, as his stage troupe performed a play loosely based on the fight beginning with the 1876-77 theatrical season. On stage and in his 1879 autobiography, Cody portrayed his fight with Yellow Hand/Yellow Hair as a duel in which "Yellow Hand" personally challenged him to single combat. The most reliable third-party accounts of the fight indicate that while Cody did kill Yellow Hair, no challenge to single combat had been issued.</note>

<note xml:id="n05">Note 5: "Baker" is <persName xml:id="baker.j">Johnny Baker</persName>. "Compton" is probably Silas "Cy" Compton (1875-1944), a former chief of cowboys for Buffalo Bill's Wild West. "Carlo" is probably Carlo (or Carlos) Miles, who had been listed as a "Mexican performer" in 1910-11 route books for Buffalo Bill's Wild West combined with Pawnee Bill's Great Far East. Contemporary newspaper accounts sometimes referred to Miles as an "Indian," perhaps due to his skin tone.  Miles (or Myles) is believed to have appeared in Cody's film <hi rend="italic">The Indian Wars</hi>.</note>

<note xml:id="n06">Note 6: Cody refers to his mining investments in Arizona, which were a considerable source of financial stress in the last years of his life. He was never able to sell these mines during his lifetime.</note>
