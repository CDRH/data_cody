<notesStmt><note>John H. Tait (c1873-1940) was with the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry (Roosevelt Rough Riders) during the Spanish American War, May 1- September 30, 1898; Tait is listed as a Roosevelt Rough Rider in the 1899 and 1902 BBWW route books but does not appear in the 1900 route book. Since <hi rend="italic">The Indian Wars</hi> was filmed in the fall of 1913, that best determines the year as 1914, especially since Cody will see only part of the pictures at that time. Frederick Bailey Hutchinson (c1872-1944), James A. Bailey's nephew, was BBWW manager for the last European tour. Carlo (or Carlos) Miles (or Myles) was listed as a "Mexican performer" in the 1910-1911 route book, was listed as a "striker" or attendant of Cody's, and "participated in the historical film by Essanay in 1913" (Kensel, p45). George Kirke Spoor (1872-1953) was an early film pioneer who, along with Broncho Billy Anderson, founded Essanay Studios in Chicago in 1907. The Essanay Film Company helped organize "The Col. W. F. Cody (Buffalo Bill) Historical Pictures Company." Harry Heye Tammen (1856-1924) and partner F. G. Bonfils were co-owners and co-editors of the <hi rend="italic">Denver Post</hi>; Tammen had various business dealings with WFC, including the making of <hi rend="italic">The Indian Wars</hi>. "Muzza-ska" is a Sioux word for money. Money ($10) may have originally been included with the letter. </note></notesStmt>

<note xml:id="n01">Note 1: Although Cody did not include the year in his dateline, this letter was most likely written in 1913. References in this letter to his motion picture <hi rend="italic">The Indian Wars</hi> as a work in progress suggest 1913, since the film was a sufficiently finished product to exhibit in Washington by February 1914. Cody has overwritten the numeral indicating the day&#8212;it could read as either 13 or 14.  Later in the letter, Cody indicates that "tomorrow" would be a Sunday. December 14, 1913, was a Sunday; which suggests that the letter was written on December 13.</note>

<note xml:id="n02">Note 2: "Fred Hutchison" is probably Frederick Bailey Hutchinson (c.1872-1944), nephew of the famous showman James A. Bailey (1847-1906). Hutchinson served as manager for Buffalo Bill's Wild West during its final European tour, 1902-1906. "Carlo" is probably Carlo (or Carlos) Miles, who had been listed as a "Mexican performer" in 1910-11 route books for Buffalo Bill's Wild West combined with Pawnee Bill's Great Far East. Contemporary newspaper accounts sometimes referred to Miles as an "Indian," perhaps due to his skin tone. Miles (or Myles) is believed to have appeared in Cody's film <hi rend="italic">The Indian Wars</hi>.</note>

<note xml:id="n03">Note 3: Cody refers to his motion picture <hi rend="italic">The Indian Wars</hi>. Principal photography for the film was done in the fall of 1913.</note>

<note xml:id="n04">Note 4: "Muzzaska" is Cody's spelling of a Siouan term for "money," likely from the Lakota language.</note>
