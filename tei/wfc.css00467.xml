<notesStmt><note>Letterhead is imprinted with the year 1895, but because of mention of April 25 in Philadelphia, the letter year is 1896 (BBWW performed in Philadelphia April 18-25, 1896). Bonner also dates this 1896. The schedule Cody lists is BBWW route schedule (other WFC letters corroborate this fact). WFC mentions 'the President;' Grover Cleveland was in office during 1896. "Burke" is likely John M. Burke. WFC refers to the play "Black America," which recounted in music the daily life of the Southern slaves. Cody, Nate Salsbury, and Lew Parker, a veteran of minstrel shows, were the management behind the show, employing three hundred Negroes and transporting them in railroad cars. After a few weeks Salsbury saw the play a failure but Cody pushed for continuing and by the fall of 1895 "Black America" was failing to catch the attention of the public. It is unclear why WFC continued to pour money into the play in March 1896, however, as the show clearly ended in late 1895. Bronson Rumsey II was one of the founding members of the town of Cody, Wyoming, and one of the directors in the Shoshone Irrigation Company that Cody put together to provide water to the Big Horn Basin. Rumsey's father (Bronson Case Rumsey) was a very wealthy businessman who owned a leather and tannery business in Buffalo, New York. Elwood Mead (1858-1936), State engineer of Wyoming and key in drafting water laws for Wyoming and Colorado from 1888 to 1899, was head of the Bureau of Reclamation from 1924 until his death in 1936. The "red bluffs" and Sulphur Creek to which WFC refers are locations south of Cody.</note></notesStmt>

<note>Note 1: Letterhead is imprinted with "1895;" Cody does not inscribe the date, but Routes List and letter context determine the year as 1896.</note>

<note>Note 2: The Wyoming government body overseeing the Carey Act was the State Land Board in Cheyenne.</note>

<note>Note 3: "Water bond" likely refers to Cody seeking to secure water rights from the State of Wyoming to sell to the German migrant families who intended to settle in the Big Horn Basin.</note>

<note>Note 4: "President" is likely President Grover Cleveland, whom Cody was hoping would soon sign over the lands for reclamation and settlement in the Big Horn Basin under the Carey Act of 1894.</note>

<note>Note 5: Bronson Rumsey's brother was Laurence Dana Rumsey, Sr., 1849-1917.</note>

<note>Note 6: Red Bluffs is a hill formation to the south and west of Cody, Wyoming,  whose red color stands out among the mountainous formations.</note>

<note>Note 7: "Sulphur creek" is a natural streambed located west of Cody, Wyoming, flowing north toward the Shoshone River along the base of Cedar Mountain.</note>

<note>Note 8: The schedule Cody lists is his itinerary for late March to April 25: Buffalo Bill's Wild West opened the 1896 season in Philadelphia April 18-25, 1896.</note>

<note>Note 9: "Black America" was the traveling show staged by Nathan Salsbury in 1895 as a representation of Southern life; the troupe numbered 300 people and was the largest African American show ever put on a stage. </note>
