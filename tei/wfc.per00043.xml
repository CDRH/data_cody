<p>The death of Colonel Wm. F. Cody, more popularly known as "Buffalo Bill," has been chronicled by the press of every civilized country in the world.  He was a picturesque, national character in his home country, and his name has been a household word.</p>
<p>His death recalls that among his numerous enterprises he engaged in the making of pictures showing the battles of Wounded Knee and War Bonnet, in the war against the Sioux Indians.</p>
<p>These pictures were made by the Buffalo Bill Historical Film Co., of which Colonel Cody was part owner.  The other owners were Essanay and the publishers of the Denver Post.</p>
<p>In October and November, 1913, the pictures were made under the supervision of General Nelson A. Miles, with a strict regard to historical accuracy, on the orders of the United States government.  As at first made the pictures were of eight-reel length, and they were released under the title, "Wars of Civilization."</p>
<p>Several regiments of the United States army were represented in the filmed battles, and over 1,500 Sioux Indians participated.  The battles were fought before the camera on the original sites, and Colonel Cody was the leading figure throughout.</p>
<p>Assisting General Miles on the occasion were General Chas. A. King, General Maus and General Frank Baldwin.  Col. Sickles, who was a lieutenant at the original battle of Wounded Knee, took part with his men in the filmed battle. </p>
<p>One of the most exciting incidents in the pictures was the singlehanded fight between Col. Cody and Yellow Hand, a Sioux Indian taking the part of the latter.</p>
<p>As the United States government has two prints of these pictures filed away in Washington as historical records, future generations will be able to see "Buffalo Bill" as he was in the flesh, both as scout and soldier.</p>
