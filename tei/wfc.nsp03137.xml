<head>BUFFALO BILL PROTESTS.</head>
<milestone unit="line"/>
<head>He Claims That the American Papers "Jump on Him" Unjustly.</head>

<p><persName xml:id="cunningham.d">Dennis Cunningham</persName>, who spent some time on his last trip with Colonel Cody and the "Wild West," asserts that the press reports that the Indians with the show were ill treated are unjust and without any foundation, as he knows personally.</p>

<p>He has received this letter from Buffalo Bill, who seems to feel the attacks keenly:

<p>BREMEN, Sept. 11.&#8212;[My Dear Dennis Cunningham.]&#8212;I don't know what I've done to be so kindly treated by some, or as near as I can find out, by most of our American papers.</p>

<p>I have endeavored and, as time will prove, I have, in foreign countries, represented America and have left as good a record, honorably and socially, as any American who has visited the old country. I was the first American who ever brought a big American company across the Atlantic. Barnum<ref target="n01">1</ref> followed after my success, but remained but three months. I have been here over three years. All the press on this side of the Atlantic have been loud in their praise and are still our friends. We have not hurt America, but have floated the star spangled banner in nearly every capital and large city in Europe; and the eagle has only been ruffled by some of our own American papers, which ere long will have the feathers of the national bird to smooth and they won't forget it.</p>

<p>We are all O K and a yard wide, and doing the biggest business we ever did.</p>

<p>Remember me to all my Nebraska friends, and tell them I expect to see them soon although I return to Europe next spring as my trip will not be quite completed this fall. I come back to finish it, then return to the country where the press sees fit to jump on a fellow because he isn't there to defend himself.</p>
