<note xml:id="n01">Note 1: Cody did not include the year in his dating of this letter. The digits 191 followed by a blank were preprinted on the hotel stationery. A "4" has been penciled in the blank by an unknown hand. Because the letter describes the production of Cody's film <hi rend="italic">The Indian Wars</hi>, which took place in the fall of 1913, it is more likely to have been written in December 1913 than in 1914.</note>

<note xml:id="n02">Note 2: Woodrow Wilson (1856-1924) served as President of the United States from 1913 to 1921.</note>

<note xml:id="n03">Note 3: Lindley M. Garrison (1864-1932), Secretary of War from 1913 to 1916, allowed active-duty cavalry soldiers to appear in Cody's film <hi rend="italic">The Indian Wars</hi>. Franklin K. Lane (1864-1921), Secretary of the Interior from 1913 to 1920, allowed Sioux Indians from the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota to appear in the film.</note>

<note xml:id="n04">Note 4: Fort Robinson, located about two miles west of Crawford, Nebraska, was then the closest U.S. Army post to the Pine Ridge reservation in nearby South Dakota. It was the home station of the cavalry soldiers that appeared in Cody's film <hi rend="italic">The Indian Wars</hi>.  No longer an active military installation, Fort Robinson is now a Nebraska state park.</note>

<note xml:id="n05">Note 5: Mrs. Schwoob's given name may have been Louise.</note>

<note xml:id="n06">Note 6: "Wharton the Producer" was Theodore Wharton (1875-1931), who is credited with directing over forty motion pictures in the 1910s and 1920s. Prince Albert I of Monaco (1848-1922; reigned 1889-1922) came to northwestern Wyoming for a hunting trip in September 1913. Among other activities on his trip, the prince attended the Park County Fair and hunted with William F. Cody. As Cody indicates in the letter, some of the prince's activities were filmed by Cody's movie crew.</note>
