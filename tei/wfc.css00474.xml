<notesStmt><note>Letter year is 1896: BBWW performed in Cumberland, Maryland, April 27, 1896. Red Lodge, Montana, lies 65 miles north of Cody and was the closest rail line to Cody. Bronson Rumsey II was one of the founding members of the town of Cody; he was one of the directors in the Shoshone Irrigation Company that Cody put together to provide water to the arid Big Horn Basin. Rumsey's father (Bronson Case Rumsey) was a very wealthy businessman who owned a leather and tannery business in Buffalo, New York. W. A. Paxton (1837-1907), one of Omaha's leading entrepreneurs, was involved in cattle, stockyards, wholesale groceries, land and politics; the Paxton-Gallagher business, founded in 1879 by William Paxton and Benjamin Gallagher, became renowned for its line of wholesale groceries, including Butternut coffee. Paxton was being pursued as a potential investor in The Shoshone Irrigation Company but later decided against joining [Bonner, p31]. George Washington Lininger (1834-1901) was the first jobber of farming implements in Nebraska when he opened the Lininger &amp; Company implement house in Omaha in 1873, a wholesale company of carriages, buggies, and agricultural implements. Lininger also founded the Lininger Art Gallery that opened in 1888 and was free to the public. In 1881 Joseph Maul Metcalf (1846-1905) became a partner, vice-president, and manager of the Lininger &amp; Metcalf Company. Elwood Mead (1858-1936), State engineer of Wyoming and key in drafting water laws for Wyoming and Colorado from 1888 to 1899, was head of the Bureau of Reclamation from 1924 until his death in 1936.</note></notesStmt>
