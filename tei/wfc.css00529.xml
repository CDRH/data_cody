<notesStmt><note>BBWW performed in New Albany, Indiana, on October 10, 1898. It appears Cody misspells Beck's name as "Bick" in haste.  George Bleistein (1861-1918) was from Buffalo, New York, who owned the Buffalo Courier Printing Company and provided printing for Buffalo Bill's Wild West. Bleistein was also a partner and director in the Shoshone Irrigation Company. "Darrow" is probably misspelled by WFC; he likely meant Hudson W. Darrah (1864-1929), a sawmill owner with other business interests in and around the town of Cody, who had a history of legal disputes with the Shoshone Irrigation Company. In 1899 Darrah filed a protest against the issuance of land patents for portions of the company's Carey Act segregation including the Cody town site, claiming that the company had not yet adequately irrigated the area in question. While Darrah's protest was not upheld when adjudicated by government authorities in July 1900, it did delay the acquisition of clear title to these lands by settlers and investors who had filed claims for them. Since the company's profitability depended on selling water rights to settlers who expected to gain clear title to the irrigated lands under the Carey Act, protests such as Darrah's were a threat to the business interests of William Cody and his partners. Nelson A. Miles (1839-1925) was a soldier who served in the American Civil War as a volunteer. In the Indian Wars Miles served in almost every major campaign against the American Indians. In 1895 he was Commanding General of the U.S. Army through the Spanish-American War. In 1913 General Miles participated in making the film "Indian Wars" with WFC.</note></notesStmt>
