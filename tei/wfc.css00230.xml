<notesStmt><note>Letter and envelope. Clarence W. Rowley, a Boston attorney, was hired to represent the Cody-Dyer Arizona Mining and Milling Company. Colonel Daniel Burns Dyer (1843-1912), former Indian agent, former president of the Augusta Railway in Georgia, and member of New York's Union League Club, became WFC's partner in the Cody-Dyer Mining and Milling Company in 1902. "Brady" may possibly be Richard G. Brady who was a Tucson businessman (1912), a miner, and a U. S. Marshal in the Arizona Territory [see Blackstone, Business, p97]. "Mr. Garlow" is Frederick Harrison Garlow (1881-1918) who married Irma Louise Cody, WFC's daughter. Commercial Clubs in Nebraska appear to have been instrumental in building and maintaining good roads. Among 19th century idioms "Dod rot" is a mild oath of exasperation, literally "God rot it." BBWW&amp;PBGFE performed in Brooklyn April 29-May 4, 1912; there was no Trenton, New Jersey, performance in 1912. "Waldorf" refers to the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York City.</note></notesStmt>

<note xml:id="n01">Note 1: William F. Cody had strong business and personal ties to the town of Cody, Wyoming, from the town's founding in 1895 to his death in 1917.</note>

<note xml:id="n02">Note 2: Buffalo Bill's Wild West Combined with Pawnee Bill's Great Far East performed in Brooklyn from April 29 to May 5, 1912.</note>

<note xml:id="n03">Note 3: This seems to be a note for $14,000 signed by Col. Dyer, Cody's partner in his unprofitable Arizona mining ventures. This note was sold to investors in Kansas City by "one R. Brady," according to an account published in Sarah J. Blackstone, <hi rend="italic">The Business of Being Buffalo Bill: Selected Letters of William F. Cody, 1879-1917</hi> (New York: Praeger, 1988), p. 97.</note>

<note xml:id="n04">Note 4: Cody is not known to have performed in Trenton, New Jersey, in 1912. The "Waldorf" is very likely the Waldorf-Astoria, a leading hotel in New York City.</note>

<note xml:id="n05">Note 5: Many cities and towns in Nebraska and other Great Plains states had "Commercial Clubs" in the early twentieth century. They seem to have been roughly equivalent to a present-day Chamber of Commerce. Both "Commercial Clubs" and "Chambers of Commerce" were represented at the first annual meeting of the National Association of Commercial Organization Secretaries in 1915.</note>

<note xml:id="n06">Note 6: A mild oath, equivalent to "God rot it."</note>
