<head>SATURDAY OCTOBER 17TH, 1891</head>

<p><persName xml:id="oakley.a">Miss Annie Oakley</persName> ("Little Sure Shot"), a member of Col. Cody's company, was the subject of a very interesting interview published in the <hi rend="italic">Brighton Guardian</hi> on Wednesday. "<persName xml:id="sitting.bull">Sitting Bull</persName>," the great Indian chief, christened Miss Oakley "Little Sure Shot" after seeing her shoot, and <hi rend="italic">honoured</hi> the young lady by admitting her into the Sioux tribe. Miss Oakley has hunted in England as well as America, and is proud of being able to say that she has shot all kinds of game, from grouse on the English mountains to deer in Northern Michigan. Her feats on horse-back are exceedingly daring, and as extraordinary as her rifle wonders. Many of these horseback feats have never been attempted by any lady before. "Little Sure Shot" is rather small in stature, and weighs only 110lbs. She is the recipient of numerous presents from the highest in Europe, including Kings, Queens, Prince and Princesses, and well known members of Royal and noble houses. On one occasion the Prince of Wales hung a medal round her neck, won at a competition at the famous London Gun Club, with the words: "I know of no one so worthy of it."</p>
  
  <pb facs="wfc.nsp11580.002"/>

<p>Colonel Cody's opinion of the little lady may be gathered from the few words written by him in "Little Sure Shot's" autograph album, which contains the names of many of the most distinguished throughout the World. The Colonel wrote: "To the loveliest, <hi rend="italic">truest</hi> little woman, both in heart and aim, throughout the world. Sworn to by me before myself. (Signed) W. F. Cody&#8212;Buffalo Bill&#8212;Strasburg, 1890." Miss Oakley has been <hi rend="italic">offered</hi> &#163;100 for this autograph album. "Little Sure Shot" married when she was sixteen, and her husband, who is not known in public life, travels with her.</p>

<p>On very wet occasions Miss Annie conducts her shooting records dressed in a waterproof riding habit. She does not fear wind or rain. On one occasion she shot in such a terrific downpour that a clay pigeon floated out of its trap before the assistant had time to let loose the spring which sends it into the air.</p>
