Irma Flats was named after Cody's daughter and located in the upper South Fork valley, where a few thousand acres would be irrigated and colonists were brought in to live; Robert Alexander Maxwell (1838-1912) from Batavia, New York, was appointed Fourth Assistant U.S. Postmaster by President Grover Cleveland in 1893 and served until the end of March 1897. "S. V. Nagle, an associate of the firm of F. A. Nagle, Commission Merchants, of Chicago" was the agent for German settlers coming to the Big Horn Basin for the promise of cheap land [See Bonner, pp69-75].</note></notesStmt>
