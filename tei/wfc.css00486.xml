Alger (1857-1906) was a banker from Sheridan, Wyoming, mayor of Sheridan in 1889, and a candidate for Governor of Wyoming in 1898.

<salute>My Dear <persName xml:id="beck.g">George</persName></salute></opener>

<p>Your favor of May 19<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> Is the most satisfactory letter I ever recd from you. But its not quite up to the Mark&#8212; As you seem to avoid what we at this end want to know and have asked time and again. We want you to list all the outside debts you have contracted And what you propose doing. As it is you contract debts and will neither give <persName xml:id="alger.h">Alger</persName> or any one else any warning of what you do&#8212; As I learn you do not keep a record of them your self of course its hard for you to remember them. I understand you keep no record of the land or Town<ref target="n02">2</ref> lots you dispose <add>of</add>

and very soon you will have our <orgName xml:id="company.s">company</orgName> in an <del>af</del> awful mix up We are aware that every thing at that end is run like a widow woman farm. No system at all&#8212; We know why the <orgName xml:id="canal.c">canal</orgName> did not hold the water and who turned four feet of water on at one time. for the purpose of <choice><sic>takeing</sic><corr>taking</corr></choice> a photograph. And <choice><sic>damageing</sic><corr>damaging</corr></choice> our co thousands of dollars&#8212;</p>

<p>You say you had seed oats on the ground. if so why did Nagle<ref target="n03">3</ref> have to go after oats? I know why the horses could not stand the work. There was no care taken of them nor no judgement used. When they were first out to work&#8212; they were killed the first day. of course the breaking <del>of</del> up &amp; <choice><sic>mooveing</sic><corr>moving</corr></choice> of camp was a big expense. Because there was no system about it. And the Boss was not on the job until 11 am</p>

<pb facs="wfc.css00486.003"/>

<p>George&#8212; I am speaking plain. I am getting the blame for this kind of management and I propose to land the blame where it belongs I am sick and tired of nonsense&#8212; and will stand it no longer&#8212; Business has got to be done on business principles or as the others say. I will say my self I will not put up another dollar and give my reasons for so doing. I was in hopes you would quit nonsense and get down to business&#8212;</p>
