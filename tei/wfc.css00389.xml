<notesStmt><note>John H. Tait (c1873-1940) was with the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry (Roosevelt Rough Riders) during the Spanish American War,  May 1-September 30, 1898; Tait is listed as a Roosevelt Rough Rider in the 1899 and 1902 BBWW route books but does not appear in the 1900 route book. Year 1914 is determined by parallel events; i.e., filming <hi rend="italic">The Indian Wars</hi> (fall 1913) and Baker in Mexico (late 1913-early 1914). "Johnny" refers to Lewis H. Baker, a/k/a Johnny Baker (1869-1931) who was Cody's foster son and a sharpshooter in BBWW. E. J. Ewing, a mining engineer hired to inspect the mine, determined that Dyer and Cody were being swindled by Lewis Getchell; 1914 Cody-Dyer Arizona Mining and Milling Co. letterhead lists Ewing as Secretary-Treasurer. "Ally" is unidentified. In WFC's postscript "Bad Land Cooper" is unidentified but may be William F. Cooper who was a Pima County (AZ) superior court judge at the time.</note></notesStmt>

<note>Note 1: Although Cody did not include the year in his dateline, this letter was most likely written in 1914. References to <persName xml:id="baker.l">"Johnny" Baker's</persName> activities in Mexico (see note 2) indicate that year.</note>

<note>Note 2: "Johnny" is Lewis H. "Johnny" Baker (1869-1931). The Mexican Revolution, which took place from 1910 to about 1920, produced much political change in Mexico, including the country's present Constitution (1917). Mexican politics during the revolutionary period generated considerable armed conflict. Cody indicates that Baker obtained images (perhaps motion pictures) of events in Mexico. <ref target="wfc.css00393">Another letter</ref> from Cody to Tait, probably written on January 27, 1914, states that Baker "may go in to old Mexico with a movie outfit."</note>

<note>Note 3: "Ewing" is E. J. Ewing, a mining engineer hired in 1912 by Cody's business partner <persName xml:id="dyer.d">Daniel Burns Dyer</persName> to examine the Arizona mining operations in which Cody and Dyer had invested. In 1914 letterhead stationery of the Cody-Dyer Arizona Mining and Milling Company listed Ewing as Secretary-Treasurer. Ewing later operated some of the Cody-Dyer mining properties himself under lease. "Pure Gold" was the name of one of 29 registered mining claims in the "Campo Bonito" group, located roughly seven miles southeast of Oracle, Pinal County, Arizona. The "Cody Tunnel" was a mine shaft located near the boundary between the "Pure Gold" claim and the adjacent "Mogul" claim.</note>

<note>Note 4: Cody's reference to "eight dollars" likely meant that a ton of ore yielded eight dollars' worth of gold. Scheelite is a mineral ore that yields tungsten. Most of the income that did eventually accrue from the Cody-Dyer mining properties was attributable to tungsten, not gold.</note>

<note>Note 5: "Burke" is <persName xml:id="burke.j">John M. Burke</persName> (1842-1917), who served as Cody's de facto press agent from the beginning of Buffalo Bill's Wild West in 1883 until both men died in 1917.</note>
