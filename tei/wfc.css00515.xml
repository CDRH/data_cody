<notesStmt><note>BBWW performed in Carroll, Iowa, on October 8, 1896. George B. Harris (d.1918) was second vice-president of CB&amp;Q and became president of the company in 1901 until his resignation in 1910; Harris then became Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad until 1918. Cody used a capital "L" in place of the word "Hell."  Elwood Mead, state engineer of Wyoming and key in drafting water laws for Wyoming and Colorado from 1888 to 1899, was head of the Bureau of Reclamation from 1924 until his death in 1936. The "ex mayor of Dubuque" was Charles J. W. Saunders (d. 1939, Mayor of Dubuque from 1891-1892), a friend of WFC's, Texas Jack, and Wild Bill Hickok; Saunders likely met WFC in Kansas toward the end of the Civil War. At the urging of Saunders, BBWW performed in Dubuque (where Saunders owned a meat market) about every four years until 1912.
