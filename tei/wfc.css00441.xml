<notesStmt><note>BBWW performed at Newport, Rhode Island, June 26, 1895. W. A. Paxton (1837-1907) was one of Omaha's leading entrepreneurs involved in cattle, stockyards, wholesale groceries, land, and politics.  The Paxton-Gallagher business became renowned for its line of wholesale groceries, including Butternut coffee. The Paxton &amp; Gallagher Wholesale Grocery Company was founded in 1879 by William Paxton and Benjamin Gallagher. Paxton was being pursued as a potential investor in The Shoshone Irrigation Company but later decided against investing [See Bonner, pp18, 31]. According to Bonner, Paxton and his group objected to Hymer. Creighton is likely John A. Creighton (1831-1907), pioneer businessman and philanthropist from Omaha, Nebraska, who founded Creighton University, owned a railroad company, and was Vice-President of the First National Bank of Omaha. William E. Hymer (~1853-1933) was one of the early members of the Shoshone Land and Irrigation Company. Dennis Cunningham and Jerry Ryan would not contribute much in the way of money to the project.  Dennis Cunningham was one of the shareholders of the company organized March 20, 1895, which later would be named the Shoshone Land and Irrigation Company [See Bonner, pp13, 31, 70, 72]. Jerry Ryan was an engineer that George T. Beck sent with Laban Hillberry (or Hillsberry) to discover if the Shoshone River could be brought around south of the mountain to irrigate a large area of the Basin. Ryan would also become a shareholder in the Shoshone Land and Irrigation Company formed in 1895. </note></notesStmt>
