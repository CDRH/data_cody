<head type="sub">THIS DAY.</head>
<p>Owing to the fine weather there was this afternoon a tremendous crowd at the Buffalo Bill's "Wild West" Show at West Bridgford, Nottingham, the number of spectators amounting probably to 20,000. Special trains were run from all parts, and the influx was so great that traffic in Arkwright-street and at Trent Bridge was choked an hour before the commencement. At three o'clock the approaches to the exhibition were thronged, every seat in the exhibition was occupied, and the pressure was enormous. During the performance of Miss Oakley a portion of the stand on the entrance side of the ground collapsed, and 500 or 600 people were precipitated to the ground; but happily, although there were nine casualties, nobody was much hurt. When quiet was restored and the people extricated themselves from their position it was fortunately discovered that there had been no serious injury. The spectators from the collapsed stand were admitted to the 4s. seate, and the programme was proceeded with uninterruptedly.</p>

<head type="sub">LATEST PARTICULARS.</head>
<p>The result of the collapse of the stand at "Buffalo Bill's" has turned out to be more serious than was at first thought. One man had his ankle dislocated, and several other persons suffering from contusions and bruises were taken home in cabs. The fall of the stand was caused it seems by people climbing up on the back, and some of those upon the structure had time to jump off before the collapse took place. The performance was in no way interfered with.</p>

<p>We learn from the General Hospital that a man named Owen Richardson, age 32, living at 75, Lamcote-street, was admitted to the Hospital this afternoon suffering from a broken ankle caused by the fall of the stand at the Wild West show.</p>
