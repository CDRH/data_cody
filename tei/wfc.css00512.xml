<notesStmt><note>BBWW performed in Ottumwa, Iowa, October 2, 1896. "Eddy" was likely Ed Goodman (1868-1949), Cody's nephew and son of Julia Cody Goodman. George Bleistein (1861-1918) from Buffalo, New York, owned the Courier Printing Company and provided printing for BBWW. Bleistein was also a partner and director in the Shoshone Land and Irrigation Company, incorporated in 1896 as Shoshone Irrigation Company. Horace C. Alger (1857-1906) was a banker from Sheridan, Wyoming, mayor of Sheridan in 1889, and candidate for Governor of Wyoming in 1898. Cody, Beck, and Alger were responsible for developing the Shoshone Irrigation Company. "Stokes" may have been Edward S. Stokes, a one-time railroad and oil magnate and businessman, and later an owner of the Hoffman House, an elegant hotel in Manhattan where WFC often resided.</note></notesStmt>

any idea of how much it will take to keep present force until election. and the entire indebtedness of Co&#8212; If you people would get up energy enough at that end to write a business letter. You could not tell as you <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know who Alger has paid&#8212; And Alger <choice><sic>wouldnt</sic><corr>wouldn't</corr></choice> tell Christ.</p>

<p>You folks from Sheridan <choice><sic>wont</sic><corr>won't</corr></choice> leave me to carry the responsibility in ignorance&#8212; If I had a few stenographers and clerks I would write more</p>
