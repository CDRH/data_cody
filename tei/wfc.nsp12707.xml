<p>Among the visitors at the Horticultural Exhibition during the past week was Mrs. Keeley, the "Jack Shepherd" of some forty years ago, the veteran actress being now within a year or two of ninety. It was her first visit to the exhibition, and her first appearance at the "Wild West." She had never even seen the vast arena, and though she had once met Buffalo Bill at some civic festivity, she had never been introduced to him. So after the performances, which the old actress thoroughly enjoyed from a critical point of view, she visited the Colonel's tent, where she remained for some time chatting agreeably with the Colonel, and relating her own experiences on the American stage in the year 1836. The Colonel said he felt proud to receive such a visitor, and hoped to see her again very often, but nothing would persuade him to believe that the comparatively youthful-looking lady before him was as old as she was represented to be.</p>

<p>Another distinguished visitor was Sir John Millais, R.A., who had come chiefly to stroll about the gardens and listen to the various bands. While he was there the Horticultural Exhibition was visited by something like 1,300 children from various schools as St. Albans and neighbouring villages, who had come for a day's outing at the invitation and expense of Miss Bingham, of their town, who "stood treat," paying for everything, including two special trains, the entrance fees, and a magnificent tea at Mr. John Bertram's restaurant. The lady herself was not present, but she was represented by her brother, Mr. W. H. Bingham-Cox, who took charge of the little ones, assisted by Mr. Richard L. Samuel and the Rev. H. W. Taylor. The pipers of the Scots Guards accompanied the little people, and each child and teacher was presented by the generous giver of the festivities with a new threepenny-piece.</p>
