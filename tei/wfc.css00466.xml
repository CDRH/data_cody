<notesStmt><note>Bronson Rumsey II was one of the founding members of the town of Cody, Wyoming, and one of the directors in the Shoshone Irrigation Company that Cody put together to provide water to the arid Big Horn Basin. Rumsey's father (Bronson Case Rumsey) was a very wealthy businessman who owned a leather and tannery business in Buffalo, New York. Frank Grouard (also spelled Gruard, among other variants; Cody writes "Gourard" here), was a 3rd Cavalry Scout at the Battle of the Rosebud; Grouard was called 'Yugata' by the Sioux. Frank Wheeler Mondell (1860-1939) was a United States Representative from Wyoming who settled in Wyoming in 1887 and developed oil and coal mines in the vicinity of Newcastle and Cambria (Wyoming). Mondell was chairman of the Committee on Irrigation of Arid Lands for the 58th and 59th Congress. "Burke" is likely John M. Burke, though it is possibly Carlton Burke, a foreman working on the Cody-Salsbury Canal. "S. V. Nagle, an associate of the firm of F. A. Nagle, Commission Merchants, of Chicago" (Bonner, pp69-75), was the agent for German settlers coming to the Big Horn Basin for the promise of cheap land. </note></notesStmt>
