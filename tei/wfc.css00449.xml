<notesStmt><note>BBWW performed in Cortland, New York, September 16, 1895. Jerry Ryan was an engineer that George T. Beck sent with Labin Hillsberry to discover if the Shoshone River could be brought south of the mountain to irrigate a large area of the Basin. Ryan would also become a shareholder in the Shoshone Land and Irrigation Company formed in 1895. [See Patrick]. Dennis Cunningham was one of the shareholders of the company organized on March 20, 1895, which later would be named the Shoshone Land and Irrigation Company. Laban Hillsberry (or Labin Hillsbury) was on old man that told George T. Beck about a big river (Shoshone River) running through the canyon that could be taken south of the mountain to irrigate a large area of land. [See Buffalo Bill's Town in the Rockies, p44; Bonner, p8]. Theo Heckert was a railroad contractor who had a "grading outfit" used in construction of the canal [See Patrick, p19; Bonner, pp13, 31, 70, 72]. George Canfield was an old friend of Cody's from Omaha and former owner of the Canfield House in Omaha, Nebraska; Cody's use of "bar" on page 2 refers to a bear getting George Canfield. Cody incorporated the W. F. Cody Hotel Co. in 1894 and purchased the inventory of Sheridan Inn (Wyoming), making him one third owner; Canfield managed both the Sheridan Inn and the W. F. Cody Transportation Company.  The town of Marquette, Wyoming, was named after George Marquette and in 1903 there was very little there except a few log houses, a post office, and a school house. When the dam was completed in 1910 the town of Marquette would disappear forever under the waters of the Shoshone River. </note></notesStmt>

I fear you did not get to the country to quick to get any option on <hi rend="underline">feed</hi>. I wrote <persName xml:id="heckart.t">Heck</persName> some time ago to Send a man there to do that. But as those people up there ought to encourage <choice><sic>enterprize</sic><corr>enterprise</corr></choice> they may not sinch you&#8212; Post your self on Wyoming <del>w</del> irrigation laws so we will <choice><sic>allways</sic><corr>always</corr></choice> be on the safe side. Am dam glad I am to get but few letters from Sheridan during the three years I have been doing business there. Not a single man ever wrote me a letter from there only just as the train was leaving

<note xml:id="n02">Note 2: "Hillsberry" refers to Laban Hillberry (or Labin Hillsberry), a prospector who was looking for investors in a water development project in the Big Horn Basin in 1893 when he met George Beck. Hillberry encouraged Beck to explore the potential for diverting water from the South Fork of the "Stinking Water" (Shoshone River) to irrigate the area. Beck then sent Jerry Ryan to evaluate the country for him; Ryan's report encouraged Beck to seriously consider the Big Horn Basin.</note>
