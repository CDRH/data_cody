                <head type="main">Buffalo Bill's Rough Riders from All Parts of the World.</head>

                <p>With the addition of many new features, international and patriotic in character,
                    and in entire consonance with the nature and purposes of his world-famed
                    exhibition, Col. W. F. Cody will give the residents of this city a chance Monday
                    to see the "Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World."</p>

                <p>The main features which have gone to make up the "Wild West" in past seasons have
                    been retained, but in addition there is much that is entirely new. a detachment
                    from the famous Roosevelt's Rough Riders, who will be seen as they appeared
                    during their memorable Cuban campaign. The fight at San Juan will be presented
                    and enacted by men who were there and fought, showing an accurate and realist
                    reproduction of the Spanish fortifications, the field of action and the march
                    and bivouac preceding the fight, with the heroic Rough Riders and horses from
                    Roosevelt's command, re-enacting the valorous deeds. Johnny Baker and Annie
                    Oakley will be seen again in their remarkable exhibition of marksmanship. The
                    United States artillery detachment will again be seen and give an idea of action
                    in the field with cannon.</p>

                <p>The different types of horsemanship are revealed in the congress of Rough Riders,
                    and is made a special feature of the exhibition, serving to bring out the styles
                    of riding of different nations. The American cavalry will give their marvelous
                    feats of horsemanship and engage in spirited rivalry with representatives from
                    the armies of England, Germany and Russia; the Arabs will astound with their
                    dare-devil riding; the Cowboys ride bucking broncos, and the Mexicans amaze by
                    their facile use of the lasso. Col. Cody will be seen in the saddle at every
                    performance and demonstrate his skill with the rifle.</p>

                <p>There will be the usual custom followed of having a street cavalcade on the
                    morning of the exhibition through the principal streets.</p>
