<notesStmt><note>Letter and envelope. Julia Cody Goodman (1843-1928) was WFC's elder sister (and eldest). "Finley" refers to Julia's son Finley Goodman (1880-1951). Roy Myers (1881-1919) was son of WFC's sister Eliza Alice Cody Myers (1848-1902). Johnny Baker (1869-1931) was WFC's foster son. "Fred Remington" was Frederic Remington (1861-1909), the artist and friend of WFC's. Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Trenton, New Jersey, May 22, 1902, which confirms the year.</note></notesStmt>

<p><choice><abbr>Recd</abbr><expan>Received</expan></choice> your letter this morning. I think I can get you transportation&#8212;North Platte to Rawlins &amp; back to Denver. It would give you a good <choice><sic>insite</sic><corr>insight</corr></choice> to how a hotel is run if you could spend two or three weeks with your Rawlings friends&#8212;And study it well. from the buying of provisions cooking them. <choice><sic>serveing</sic><corr>serving</corr></choice> them&#8212; wages of cooks helpers. waiters &amp; c. I think I should build an outside house for Laundry. &amp; sleeping rooms for servants. What do you think? You will have to study how to run the bed rooms. how often sheets are changed&#8212;how many rooms one chambermaid takes care of &amp; c. I am going to buy the very best of furniture &amp; bedsteads &amp; <choice><sic>matrasses</sic><corr>mattresses</corr></choice>. have got fine oil paintings for office Parlors &amp; dining

room. And over two hundred etchings from the paintings of artists like Fred Remington &amp; others all framed&#8212; I will have two Pianos one for Parlor. &amp; one for dining room. I tell 
you I am going to have this hotel out of sight&#8212;I will make it the talk of the West&#8212;</p>

<p>I think I have found a manager and one without a wife&#8212;I dont want any wife to be bothering you. You are to be the mother of that hotel&#8212;<del>Let</del> I play Denver Aug. 6th &amp; 7th You could make your visit to Rawlings in July then Aug the 8th start for Cody&#8212; Your future home. I have got a mountain picked out big enough for us all to be <choice><sic>burried</sic><corr>buried</corr></choice> on. Finley wrote me and wanted me to start him with a harness shop. I told him that he must first <choice><sic>proove</sic><corr>prove</corr></choice> to

me that he was worthy of it. So far he had not made a hit with me. I was so in hopes that he would be another Roy Meyers or Johnie Baker&#8212; And let us hope he may yet. When he proves he is worthy. And capable I will do the right thing by him. but not till he shows me. I have a nice little 160 acre farm ten miles from Cody&#8212; a nice six room log house on it all fenced the river runs through it. the finest pure water spring in the country close to the house I have put a man and wife on it. to raise chickens. make butter. And next year vegetables for the hotel&#8212; the chickens &amp; butter will be ready for the hotel Sep 15th. This will be the hotel farm. </p>
