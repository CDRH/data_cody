<notesStmt><note>BBWW performed in Owosso, Michigan, August 1, 1896. Horace C. Alger (1857-1906) was a banker from Sheridan, Wyoming, mayor of Sheridan in 1889, and candidate for Governor of Wyoming in 1898. Cody, Beck and Alger were responsible for developing the Shoshone Irrigation Company. "Meade" was misspelled by WFC: Elwood Mead (1858-1936) was appointed Wyoming territorial engineer in 1888, and was Wyoming's first state engineer, serving until 1899. As such, Mead was intimately involved in the drafting and administration of Wyoming's water laws. Mead's engineering reports on the Shoshone River provided crucial backing for William F. Cody and his partners in the Cody Canal project. George Bleistein (1861-1918), Buffalo, New York, owned the Courier Printing Company and provided printing for BBWW. Bleistein was also a partner and director in the Shoshone Irrigation Company. Charles Trego (1856-1925) was a personal friend of WFC and a foreman for both Scout's Rest Ranch in North Platte, Nebraska, and the TE Ranch in Cody, Wyoming. Called 'Yugata' by the Sioux, Frank Grouard (also spelled Gruard, among other variants), was a 3rd Cavalry Scout at the Battle of the Rosebud. "S. V. Nagle, an associate of the firm of F. A. Nagle, Commission Merchants, of Chicago" was the agent for German settlers coming to the Big Horn Basin for the promise of cheap land  [Bonner, p69-75). William E. Hymer (~1853-1933) was one of the early members of the Shoshone Land and Irrigation Company.</note></notesStmt>

try and give our settlers the first chance&#8212; Trego has money to pay off all men Grouard had working for me. And Trego will keep things straight.
