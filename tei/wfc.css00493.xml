<notesStmt><note>BBWW performed in Newark, Ohio, July 14, 1896. "Meade" was misspelled by WFC: Elwood Mead (1858-1936) was appointed Wyoming territorial engineer in 1888, and was Wyoming's first state engineer, serving until 1899. As such, Mead was intimately involved in the drafting and administration of Wyoming's water laws. Mead's engineering reports on the Shoshone River provided crucial backing for William F. Cody and his partners in the Cody Canal project. Horace C. Alger (1857-1906) was a banker from Sheridan, Wyoming, mayor of Sheridan in 1889, and candidate for Governor of Wyoming in 1898. Cody, Beck and Alger were responsible for developing the Shoshone Irrigation Company.</note></notesStmt>

<note xml:id="n01">Note 1: BBWW performed in Newark, Ohio, on July 14, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "Newark, Ohio. / Tuesday, July 14. Arrived in town 4 A. M. Three-quarter mile haul to lot. A Newark paper of this evening, in commenting upon the parade, said 'that the Show had two steam caliopes, but they could not play either one of them, but that the people appreciated them just the same.' Kinura, the Japanese magician of the Annex, closed to-day on account of ill health and left for New York. This is the French Fourth of July, and the French soldiers did all they could in a  small way to celebrate. Just as the audience was dismissed this evening we had the hardest rain of the season. It was more severe than any of us had ever witnessed--old showmen having never seen its equal. It put out a beacon-light, and, as is quite a common case, the electric street railway was disabled just as the people desired to get home. All our teams had to be doubled in order to get our stuff all off of the lot, and the last wagon did not leave until 12.30. / Business in the afternoon big, in the evening light. / Lot, 14th and Church streets. / Arena, 181 x 386."</note>

<note xml:id="n02">Note 2: "Flood" is likely D. P. Flood who wrote to Beck in 1896 and is mentioned by Cody in correspondence to Beck. Flood may have been a foreman or livestock handler employed on the irrigation project; his exact role is not known.</note>

<note xml:id="n03">Note 3: "Meade" is Elwood Mead.</note>
