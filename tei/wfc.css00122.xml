<notesStmt><note>Letter and envelope. Curtis L. Hinkle was clerk of the Wyoming State Land Board in Cheyenne and friend to WFC. Solon L. Wiley (1840-1926), an Omaha businessman, built the Bench Canal on the Greybull River and was instrumental in the Oregon Basin irrigation project (Wyoming). Shoshone Irrigation Company was organized in 1895 (incorporated in 1896) to run the Cody &amp; Salsbury Canal project [see Bonner]. "Mr. Bond" was likely Fred Bond, who succeeded Elwood Mead as Wyoming State Engineer [see Bonner, pp143-147]. "Sweeds" likely refers to Swedish immigrants settling in Wyoming and Montana.</note></notesStmt>

Engineer would appreciate this- And use their influence to get these Gentlemen to take the water out of the river in the Canyon. This is going to be an expensive Canal.

<note xml:id="n01">Note 1: Cody refers to two Wyoming state government entities&#8212;the Board of Land Commissioners (of which Curtis Hinkle was chief clerk) and the office of the state engineer.  Both of these authorities played a role in overseeing irrigation projects in the state.</note>

<note xml:id="n02">Note 2: On early maps of the area Shoshone River was listed as "Stinking Water River." The Shoshone River Canyon is a deep canyon between Rattlesnake Mountain and Cedar Mountain west of Cody, Wyoming. Heart Mountain's summit is about ten miles northwest of Cody. Both the power plant and irrigation system watering the lands around Heart Mountain envisioned by William F. Cody in this letter were eventually built by the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation as part of the Shoshone Project after Cody relinquished his development rights to the government.</note>

<note xml:id="n03">Note 3: Mormon settlers organized as the Big Horn Basin Colonization Company were then at work on the Sidon Canal on the lower Shoshone River.  Certified as complete by the Wyoming state engineer in 1903, the canal irrigates about 20,000 acres of land near the towns of Byron, Lovell, and Cowley.  William F. Cody and Nate Salsbury had been persuaded to give up a portion of their water rights for the Cody-Salsbury canal<!--link to Cody-Salsbury Canal--> in order to leave sufficient flow for the Sidon Canal. Here Cody expresses the belief that if Mormon settlers were to obtain and irrigate more land on the lower Shoshone River, the water rights remaining for Cody and Salsbury to sell to others would not generate enough revenue to finance their own canal project.</note>

<note xml:id="n04">Note 4: Cody's promise of a large band of Swedish settlers in the Big Horn Basin did not materialize.</note>

<note xml:id="n05">Note 5: Cody and his partners in the Shoshone Irrigation Company were then considering an offer from Omaha businessman <persName xml:id="wiley.s">Solon L. Wiley</persName> to buy them out.  Wiley was unable to secure the needed financing, and the deal eventually fell apart.</note>

<note xml:id="n06">Note 6: DeForest Richards (1846-1903) was then the governor of Wyoming.  Fred Bond (1856-1903) was then Wyoming state engineer.</note>

<note xml:id="n07">Note 7: The Hoffman House was then a leading New York City hotel.  Cody often stayed at the Hoffman House when he was in the city.</note>
