<notesStmt><note>BBWW performed in Boston, Massachusetts, from May 30 to June 4, 1898. Henry M. Gerrans was director and an investor in the Shoshone Irrigation Company. Gerrans had been a resident of Buffalo, New York, since 1869; in 1889 Gerrans and partner William E. Wolley became proprietors of the Iroquois Hotel, the premier hostelry in Buffalo where WFC was occasionally a guest. On April 18, 1898, just before the outbreak of the Spanish-American War, WFC volunteered to raise a company of scouts for the U.S. Army; war was declared on April 25, and General Miles offered WFC an appointment to his staff. Two of Cody's horses were sent to Cuba, but Cody ultimately did not go; by July 17th the formal surrender occurred. George S. Russell was the carpenter that built most of the initial buildings of the new town of Cody [See Patrick, pp28-29]. "Forbes" oversaw the construction of Forbes Trading Company, which later became Cody Trading Company; when the building was completed, Forbes was replaced by Jacob Schwoob who had been manager of the Iroquois [See Patrick, pp25-26]. W. P. Webster was a machinist by trade and the Postmaster of Cody in 1900. Nelson A. Miles (1839-1925) was a soldier who served in the American Civil War as a volunteer, serving in the Indian Wars in almost every major campaign; in 1895 Miles was Commanding General of the U.S. Army during the Spanish-American War. In 1913 General Miles participated in filming "Indian Wars" with WFC.</note></notesStmt>

<p>Your May 27<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi> George I am <choice><sic>haveing</sic><corr>having</corr></choice> hell&#8212; 28 days of rain you know what that means to me just now. I note what you say about the mill. But I wished you had told me something of our affairs out there&#8212; Webster<ref target="n02">2</ref> writes me he <choice><sic>hasnt</sic><corr>hasn't</corr></choice> rec<hi rend="sup">d</hi> pay for bridge. I have no idea of what is owed out there. Why <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> you let some of us know. is it right that the members of our Co are not informed of their obligations. I should think you would be glad to tell them. So you would not be bothered with creditors. So far I have been unable to get any one but <persName xml:id="salsbury.n">Salsbury</persName> to put up&#8212; But a wire from <persName xml:id="bleistein.g">Bleistein</persName> <choice><sic>to days</sic><corr>today</corr></choice> says Buffalo<ref target="n03">3</ref> <choice><sic>will will</sic><corr>will</corr></choice> let me know Monday. So if they send <persName xml:id="alger.h">Alger</persName> money I hope you will pay Webster and other bills there&#8212; I wrote Alger that if any of your checks came in for Labor &amp;c. his Bank

<pb facs="wfc.css00521.001"/>

ought to take care of them for a few days as his Bank had never lost a cent by our co. I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know what he done with money Salsbury sent him $1500.</p>

<p>In fact we <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> know anything at this end how things are going. And we all feel that you should let us know.</p>

<closer><salute>Very truly yours</salute>

<postscript><p>P. S. Russell<ref target="n05">5</ref> says he <choice><sic>hasnt</sic><corr>hasn't</corr></choice> been paid for store.

You know what the contract was&#8212; I told Bleistein &amp; <persName xml:id="gerrans.h">Gerrans</persName> and they said they would pay Russell. Wish you would see Forbes about it. and get it fixed up&#8212; I am quite ill &amp; all these things <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> make me any better</p></postscript>
