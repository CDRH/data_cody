<notesStmt><note>BBWW performed in Springfield, Ohio, on July 7, 1896. "E. R. Goodman" was Edward Robert Goodman (1868-1949), Cody's nephew and son to Julia Cody Goodman. Lewis H. Baker, a/k/a Johnny Baker (1869-1931) was Cody's foster son and a sharpshooter in BBWW. William Sweeney (1856-1917), cornet player, organized and directed the Cowboy Band in BBWW; Sweeney was with WFC for the entire run of the show, from 1883 until the 1913 "Farewell Tour" with the "Two Bill's Show." M. F. Polhamus remains unidentified. 'Berch' is likely BBWW Chief of Cowboys George Burch, who tended stock at BBWW's winter quarters [Russell, p416]. Snyder is likely William "Okie" Snyder, WFC's ranch manager and "...one of the Colonel's men who had taken 160 acres near Irma..." [Bonner; p64, pp 278n5]</note></notesStmt>

<p>I dont know whether I am doing this right or not or whether you can understand it. So I want you to answer me at once and let me know. If I am wrong I will correct it. Annother thing I fear without you have a good functional reliable man to handle the sales of water rights Lots &amp;c&#8212; Our co sooner or later will have trouble on their hands that they cannot say <choice><sic>lets</sic><corr>let's</corr></choice> pocket the losses and let it go. But it will involve not only our company into endless trouble but the purchaser and the state, and <choice><sic>finaly</sic><corr>finally</corr></choice> the government&#8212; So I wish you would please let me know who has charge of this department.</p>

<p>Now as <hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="alger.h">Alger</persName></hi> is in the Basin&#8212; I send you $500 payable to him. Now please be careful and understand &amp; make no mistake

<p>William Sweeny<ref target="n02">2</ref> $200.&#8212; to pay on his $160. first payment and <del>$1</del> of $160. and $40 to go to the state. George. Berch<ref target="n03">3</ref>&#8212; $200. same as Sweeney.</p>

<p>The $100 check is to pay the State charges on the lands of William Snyder<ref target="n04">4</ref> <persName xml:id="baker.l">Louis H. Baker</persName>. each 160 acres $40 each&#8212; and $20 to pay on M. F.

<p>Now as I wrote you as <persName xml:id="goodman.e">E. R.

<note xml:id="n01">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in Springfield, Ohio, on July 7, 1896. The day's entry in the 1896 Route Diary: "Springfield, Ohio. / Tuesday, July 7. Arrived in town at 5 A. M. Two-mile haul to lot. If ever Anderson prayed for still weather he did to-day. We could not get a stake down over twelve inches anywhere and the least wind would have blown us down, but with our usual good luck we came out all right. Refreigo Carrello, a Mexican, was thrown in the grand entree to-day; his left shoulder was badly hurt and sprained and he received a lot of small bruises and was badly used up. Master-Mechanic Dan Taylor left to-day for Columbus, Ohio, to get the grounds ready for our next Monday's engagement. / Business at both performances good. / Lot, Columbus and Isabell streets. / Arena, 182 x 368."</note>
