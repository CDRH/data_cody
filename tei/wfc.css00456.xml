<notesStmt><note>BBWW performed in Wilmington, North Carolina, October 7, 1895; October 6th was a Sunday. The Duluth Press newspaper was purchased by Cody for his sister Helen and her husband Hugh Wetmore. Cody's mention of "Atlanta" likes refers to the Cotton States and International Exposition held in Atlanta, Georgia, from mid-September through December 1895, which would have been a good place to promote the Big Horn Basin. John A. Peake was editor at one time of the <hi rend="italic">North Platte Enterprise</hi>. Peake would become editor of the <hi rend="italic">Cody Enterprise</hi>, having co-founded the newspaper with WFC August 1899.  Robert Foote (1834-1916), a state senator representing Johnson County, Wyoming, led the effort against the Carey Act in Wyoming. "Sulpher" probably refers to Sulpher Creek, a natural streambed west of Cody, Wyoming, that flows north toward the Shoshone River along the base of Cedar Mountain.</note></notesStmt>
