<p>Just came in from branding calves. tired out but feeling bully otherwise. <unclear reason="illegible">taned</unclear> to beat <choice><orig>h&#8212;</orig></choice> Sorry you were feeling so blue. and if I was not so hard pushed for scads I would just send you a hundred for luck. but I am pushed to the wall until I can ship <add>beeves</add> or get to work. if I were not going away so soon would have you to come out. but I will make a brake next week first to Colorado then to N.Y. back to Davenport. Iowa where I open Sep. 1st. in regard to you going on the boards again. I must think of it I have not part in either of my dramas that would be suitable for you to play. as I did say that I would never again have another

Scout or western man with me that is one <choice><sic>whoom</sic><corr>whom</corr></choice> I would work up. for just as soon as they see their names in print a few times they git the big head. and want to start a company of their own. I will name <choice><sic>afew</sic><corr>a few</corr></choice>. Wild Bill. Texas Jack. John Nelson. Oregon Bill. Kit Carson.Capt Jack &amp;c. all busted flat before they were out a month. and wanted to come back because I would not take them then they talked about me. But old Pard I <choice><sic>dont</sic><corr>don't</corr></choice> <choice><sic>realy</sic><corr>really</corr></choice> believe you are that kind of a hair pin. And I will see what can be done. I see in a Chicago paper the other day. where Kit Carson.(Jr.) was arrested for <choice><sic>strikeing</sic><corr>striking</corr></choice> his wife with intent to kill. was bound over to the next court. I expected as much. when he married that old dame. Kit by the way <choice><sic>aint</sic><corr>ain't</corr></choice> a bad fellow. but he thought at one time that he was a little K Christ. He is out of luck. had better stuck to the old man. run out of paper good by&#8212;</p>
