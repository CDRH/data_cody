<notesStmt><note>BBWW performed in Racine, Wisconsin, August 29, 1896. W. A. Paxton (1837-1907), one of Omaha's leading entrepreneurs, was involved in cattle, stockyards, groceries, land, and politics; the business became renowned for its line of  wholesale groceries, including Butternut coffee. The Paxton &amp; Gallagher Wholesale Grocery Company was founded in 1879 by William Paxton and Benjamin Gallagher.  Paxton was being pursued as a potential investor in The Shoshone Irrigation Company but later decided against joining [See Bonner, p31].  "Eddy" might be Ed Goodman (1868-1949), WFC's nephew, son of Julia Cody Goodman.</note></notesStmt>

<salute>My Dear <persName xml:id="beck.g">Beck</persName></salute></opener>

<p>Thanks for letter and pictures. Send all you can as I can use them talking up our <choice><sic>Enterprize</sic><corr>Enterprise</corr></choice>. You <del>are</del> <choice><sic>ceartainly</sic><corr>certainly</corr></choice> are going to keep pegging away at the red bluff<ref target="n02">2</ref> &amp; <choice><sic>sollid</sic><corr>solid</corr></choice> rock. <persName xml:id="salsbury.n">Salsbury</persName> told me you were and I think the Buffalo men<ref target="n03">3</ref> understands you are. And I think you ought to work a force large enough to work to <del>d</del> Advantage at least&#8212; As you have <add>a</add> stenographer<ref target="n04">4</ref> paid by the Co. You should let each member of the Co know <choice><sic>whats</sic><corr>what's</corr></choice> going on. And tell them what you would like to do&#8212; that would be of benefit to Co. &amp;c&#8212; As <persName xml:id="alger.h">Alger</persName> has paid Paxton &amp; Co<ref target="n05">5</ref>

And as you have to keep men to run the store. If you can <hi rend="underline">sell</hi> anything to advantage how would it do to buy a small stock of goods on <hi rend="underline">90</hi> days time? <persName xml:id="goodman.e">Eddy</persName> writes he has wholesale prices from different firms. here tofore we have been buying to high. if goods <choice><sic>cant</sic><corr>can't</corr></choice> be bought right there will be no <choice><sic>proffit</sic><corr>profit</corr></choice>. Salsbury writes thinks Bonds can be placed after Election. Wish you would write Buffalo parties what you owe out there and that people are worrying you for their pay&#8212; it might help to get them to exert their selves. As it pretty tough on two of us to carry this <choice><sic>Enterprize</sic><corr>Enterprise</corr></choice>&#8212;</p>

We had a series of small things happen on our run to-night; among them was the falling of a brake-rod and a bad flat wheel, which delayed us so that we did not get into town until 6.30 A. M. One-mile haul to lot. Edward C. Wiebe, of the electric-light department, left to-day to join the Augustine Neuville Dramatic Company, at Louisville, Ky. John Curly left again to-night to go to the hospital in Milwaukee. James Rushenberger returned to-day from St. Luke's Hospital, Chicago. Indian Two Dog and wife closed to-day and left for Pine Ridge Agency to-night. M. Coyle, excursion agent and railroad manager, was with us to-day. To-night closes one of the best weeks of the season, so far as a financial basis is considered/ Weather warm, and everything that could be desired. / Business good at both performances. / Lot, Fair Grounds. / Arena, 187 x 363."</note>
