<notesStmt><note>Horace C. Alger (1857-1906) was a banker from Sheridan, Wyoming. He was mayor of Sheridan in 1889 and a candidate for Governor of Wyoming in 1898. Cody, Beck and Alger were responsible for developing the Shoshone Irrigation Company. Bronson Rumsey II was one of the founding members of the town of Cody, Wyoming. He was one of the directors in the Shoshone Irrigation Company that Cody put together to provide water to the arid country in the Big Horn Basin. His father (Bronson Case Rumsey) was a very wealthy businessman who owned a leather and tannery business in Buffalo, New York. The foreman that Cody refers to as "Burke" was probably Carlton Burke, not Major John M. Burke; Carlton Burke was a foreman on the irrigation project. Elwood Mead (1858-1936) was State engineer of Wyoming and key in drafting water laws for Wyoming and Colorado from 1888 to 1899, was head of the Bureau of Reclamation from 1924 until his death in 1936. "Stokes" may refer to Edward S. Stokes (1841-1901) who was at one time a railroad and oil magnate and businessman. In 1872 Stokes served four years in Sing-Sing Prison for the murder of his business partner, Jim Fisk. Stokes was an owner of the Hoffman House, an elegant hotel in Manhattan, where WFC often resided. </note></notesStmt>

<salute>My Dear <persName xml:id="beck.g">George</persName></salute></opener>

<p>Have just rec<hi rend="sup">d</hi> a letter from <persName xml:id="alger.h">Alger</persName>, saying he had rec<hi rend="sup">d</hi> a letter from you saying <persName xml:id="rumsey.b">Rumsey</persName> sent him $5000. ten more necessary for apr 10<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="underline">th</hi></hi>. I sent him $2000 from Omaha&#8212; Stokes<ref target="n01">1</ref> sent 3000. all gone. have you ever counted up how much money you have chucked out&#8212; and the <orgName xml:id="canal.c">ditch</orgName> not completed to Sulphur creek<ref target="n02">2</ref> yet. have you ever given it a serious thought. You said $50,000 would water 25000 acres&#8212; at the rate its going it will take $150,000


<pb facs="wfc.css00470.002"/>


Yes it will be a good idea to all have fast horses ready at this rate.<ref target="n03">3</ref> I have written Alger I want an itemised statement of where the money has gone and for Mr Rumsey &amp; <persName xml:id="mead.e">Mead</persName> to know&#8212; for the <orgName xml:id="canal.cs">ditch</orgName> is costing to much. And Mead may be able to give some valuable advise. I want him to make a report&#8212; so I can show it to the co&#8212; George&#8212; Your foreman like Burke<ref target="n04">4</ref> last fall must be just killing time with his men&#8212; instead of makeing them work to advantage You should be able to tell by this time if you would look them over at work if they were working for our interest. Something fearfully wrong some place George. An awful leak that must be <choice><sic>stoped</sic><corr>stopped</corr></choice> at once&#8212; I have rec<hi rend="sup">d</hi> no<del>t</del> report for months what has been done&#8212; Everything neglected. </p>
