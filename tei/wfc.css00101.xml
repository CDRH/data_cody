<notesStmt><note>Curtis L. Hinkle was clerk of the Wyoming State Land Board in Cheyenne and friend to WFC [see Blackstone (Business)]. Charles DeMaris (1833-1914) discovered and developed the hot springs on the western edge of Cody, Wyoming, known as DeMaris Springs. Cody Military College International Academy of Rough Riders was founded by WFC but failed to prosper as he had hoped. General Edwin Vose Sumner, Jr. (1835-1912) was a veteran of the Civil War and the Indian Wars. Governor Deforest Richards (1846-1903) was governor of Wyoming from 1899 until he died in office in April 1903. Elwood Mead, State engineer of Wyoming and key in drafting water laws for Wyoming and Colorado from 1888 to 1899, was head of the Bureau of Reclamation from 1924 until his death in 1936. Page 3 (page 2 verso) may be transcription of a report written by Elwood Mead in 1898 rejecting WFC's application to use the water of DeMaris Springs [see Bonner, p50+]. BBWW performed in New York City April 2-20, 1901.</note></notesStmt>

<note xml:id="n01">Note 1: Buffalo Bill's Wild West performed in New York City from April 2 to April 20, 1901.</note>

<note xml:id="n02">Note 2: When public lands were surveyed as a precursor to settlement, certain one-mile-square sections known as "school sections" were designated. Revenue from the sale or lease of these sections was reserved to support public schools.</note>

<note xml:id="n03">Note 3: Edwin Vose Sumner (1835-1912) joined the U.S. Army in 1861 and fought in the Civil War. He made the Army his career after the Civil War, serving as an officer in several cavalry regiments. After serving in the Spanish-American War, Sumner retired with the rank of brigadier general in 1899.</note>

<note xml:id="n04">Note 4: The words "near Cody" appear to have been added later in pencil. The handwriting matches that of William F. Cody.</note>

<note xml:id="n05">Note 5: DeForest Richards (1846-1903) was then the governor of Wyoming. Cody may refer to his predecessor as governor, William A. Richards. DeForest Richards and William A. Richards are not known to be related.</note>

<note xml:id="n06">Note 6: Here begins a body of writing in pencil, not in Cody's handwriting. This material appears to be a transcription of a document written in 1898 by Elwood Mead, who was then Wyoming's state engineer, denying William F. Cody's 1896 application for water rights at DeMaris Springs.</note>
