<notesStmt><note>WFC reference to the "80% of Capital" can be interpreted as the investors in the Big Horn Basin. "S. V. Nagle, an associate of the firm of F. A. Nagle, Commission Merchants, of Chicago" was the agent for German settlers coming to the Big Horn Basin for the promise of cheap land [Bonner, pp69-75]. Charles Hayden was a surveyor and assistant manager with the Shoshone Irrigation Company [Bonner, pp53-55]. In May of 1896 both George T. Beck and surveyor Charles Hayden would stake out the town site of Cody. Dennis Cunningham was one of the shareholders of the company organized on March 20, 1895, which later would be named the Shoshone Land and Irrigation Company [Bonner, pp13, 31, 70, 72]. WFC's use of 'bared' on Page 2 may have been a misspelling of 'barred.' George Holdrege, the general manager of the Chicago, Burlington, &amp; Quincy Railroad Company, was interested in development along the proposed rail lines including the irrigation project that Cody had undertaken. </note></notesStmt>
