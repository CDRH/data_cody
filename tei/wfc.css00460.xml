<notesStmt><note>BBWW performed in Atlanta, Georgia, October 28-November 2, 1895. Horace C. Alger (1857-1906) was a banker from Sheridan, Wyoming, mayor of Sheridan in 1889, and a candidate for Governor of Wyoming in 1898. Cody, Beck, and Alger were responsible for developing the Shoshone Irrigation Company. The Carey Act, passed by Congress in 1894 and named after Wyoming's U.S. senator Joseph M. Carey (1845-1924), was meant to encourage the irrigation and settlement of arid western lands. The federal government would grant up to one million acres of public land to western states, which would then contract with private companies to build irrigation systems. Investors in a Carey Act project expected to profit from selling water rights to settlers in the newly-irrigated area, while state authorities were charged with certifying that the irrigation works were adequate and with overseeing the process by which settlers would eventually acquire title to their farms. Nathan "Nate" Salsbury (1846-1902) was an actor and head of the Troubadours, a traveling stock company which would eventually tour Europe and the United States. After Cody met Salsbury the "Wild West" show venture would begin and in 1884 Salsbury would become a partner as well as Vice-President and Manager of Buffalo Bill's Wild West until his death on December 24, 1902. E. van Dreveldt was a civil engineer that platted the town of Cody City along with Charles Hayden in October 1895. Theo Heckert was a railroad contractor who had a "grading outfit" used in construction of the canal [See Patrick, p19]. </note></notesStmt>
