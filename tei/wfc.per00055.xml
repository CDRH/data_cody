<milestone unit="line"/>

<p>THE forthcoming <orgName xml:id="exhibition.am">American Exhibition</orgName> shortly to be opened in London is causing some excitement, and the Hon. Wm. Cody&#8212;better known as "Buffalo Bill"&#8212;is the hero of the hour. The life of this redoubtable hunter and scout is one of the most remarkable of modern times, and furnishes another proof of the accuracy of the old adage that "truth is stranger than fiction." He commenced his career as a cowboy, and even in early life he became famous as a hunter and a youth of great courage, skill, and powers of endurance. Later on, when American troops came to fight the Indians, he turned the knowledge he had gained during long years of hardships and perils to excellent account, and was appointed scout to the army. His advice was always eagerly sought for by the generals, and he took rank with them as equal, and their mess was his mess. Finally, Cody was appointed Chief Scout, which appointment ranks with that of major-general. His next work was to organize a body of cowboys, all fighters by instinct and training, to protect the workers on the lines of railway pushed into the prairie. He also provided these large gangs of men with beef and with buffalo meat, &amp;c., and over this undertaking made money. Then he took a ranche on his own account, and worked it very successfully. After a while he was invited to New York, and all were so anxious to see this man of whom rumour spoke in such flattering terms, that he was induced to exhibit in the towns of America his prowess with rifle and revolver. Lastly, William Cody decided to collect a number of Indians and cowboys, and show throughout the States genuine frontier life as it had been. Buffalo Bill is really the last pioneer of the States, and the story of his early career as set forth in the story which will be commenced next week is, therefore, one of absorbing interest.</p>
