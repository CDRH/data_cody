<note>Note 1: Cody performed with the 101 Ranch Shows in New Bedford, Massachusetts on July 3, 1916. July 2 was a Sunday, with no performance scheduled.</note>

<note>Note 2: Cody may refer to Major General Hugh L. Scott (1853-1934), who was then Chief of Staff of the United States Army. Cody had written General Scott on February 26, 1916, to request that some soldiers be furloughed for the purpose of appearing in his "military pageant" on "preparedness" that was the central feature of Cody's final season in show business.</note>

<note>Note 3: "McCluskey" might be W. H. McCloskey, who was listed in the "Confectionery Department" in the 1896 route book for Buffalo Bill's Wild West.</note>

<note>Note 4: Cody's term "privileges" seems to encompass what would be called "concessions" today. "That show" may be the Sells-Floto Circus. John Tait was employed by Sells-Floto during the 1916 show season.</note>

<note>Note 5: The Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus was then owned by the Ringling brothers, who had purchased it following the 1906 death of James A. Bailey. The Ringlings operated it separately from their own Ringling Brothers Circus until 1919, when the two shows were combined.</note>
