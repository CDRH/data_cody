      <div class="note">Christopher Columbus Augur (1821-1898) graduated from West Point Military Academy in the same year as U. S. Grant, 1843. During the Mexican-American War of 1846-48, Augur acted as aide-de-camp to Generals Enos D. Hopping and Caleb Cushing. He subsequently fought in the Rogue River War in Southern Oregon in 1855-56, then served briefly as commandant of cadets at West Point in 1861, and reported in the same year to Washington, D.C. as part of the forces defending the Union capitol. At the end of the war he served as the officer in charge of escorting Abraham Lincoln's body to the White House after the president's assassination on the evening of April 14, 1865. Augur later commanded the Department of the Platte from 1867-1871 and the Department of Texas from 1871-1875. He retired from the service in 1885 with the rank of brigadier general.</div>
