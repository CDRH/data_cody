      <div class="note">Nathan Augustus Monroe Dudley (1825-1910) received his commission on March 3, 1855, as a second lieutenant in the Tenth U.S. Infantry directly from civilian life. Six years later he commanded a company in that regiment as captain. By March 1, 1862, he became the colonel of the Thirtieth Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry where he earned laurels as a "lead from the front" officer during several fights in Louisiana. Before the Civil War's conclusion, he had become a major in the Fifteenth U.S. Infantry, and with a reorganization of the army in 1866, served in that grade in the Twenty-fourth U.S. Infantry. Three years later, when another major army reorganization took place, Dudley transferred to the Third U.S. Cavalry, serving with that regiment until a vacancy in the Ninth U.S. Cavalry, a regiment of buffalo soldiers, resulted in his promotion to lieutenant colonel on July 1, 1876. He was post commander at Fort Stanton, New Mexico, as well as the regiment's second in command at the onset of the Lincoln County War (1877-1879), a conflict in which "Billy the Kid" played a dubious role. Dudley, too, came out with a mixed reputation from the part he played in this controversial episode. He fared somewhat better in the campaign against the Apache chief Victorio. Later, on June 6, 1885, he transferred to the First U.S. Cavalry when he received a promotion as the regimental colonel. Dudley retired on August 20, 1889.</div>
