      <div class="note">Wesley Merritt (1834-1910) graduated from the U.S. Military Academy on July 1, 1860, receiving his commission as a second lieutenant in the Second U.S. Dragoons, a regiment that would be re-designated the Second U.S. Cavalry early in the Civil War.  It was with this unit that he served as a troop officer for the early part of that conflict. On July 11, 1863, Merritt's leadership skills brought about his promotion from a captain with the Second to a brigadier general of volunteers and by the war's end he wore the two stars of a major general of volunteers. His wartime experience included assignments as aide-de-camp, adjutant, and commander of the Reserve Brigade, First Division, Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac in the Gettysburg campaign. Following the Civil War, Merritt continued to serve in the cavalry along the American frontier starting with his first frontier duties as the lieutenant colonel of the Ninth U.S. Cavalry (buffalo soldiers) in Texas.  On July 1, 1876, he transferred upon his promotion to colonel of the Fifth U.S. Cavalry. Merritt immediately joined the regiment in the field, where on July 17, 1876, he led his men at Warbonnet Creek in a battle that brought W. F. Cody increased fame and became a linchpin of his legendâ€”"The First Scalp for Custer." Afterward Merritt was assigned as chief of cavalry for the Big Horn and Yellowstone expedition in which role he participated in the fighting at Slim Buttes. Not long after these field operations Merritt became superintendent of West Point from 1882 to 1887, and later was appointed brigadier general in the U.S. Army. His promotion to major general came in 1895. At the advent of the Spanish-American War Merritt served as commander of the Department of the East and later, following the Battle of Manila, became the first American military governor of the Philippines. He filled this position for a short time before being relieved to advise the U.S. delegation in the peace negotiations leading to the Treaty of Paris that formally ended hostilities between Spain and the United States. Merritt retired from the Army in 1900.</div>
