      <div class="note">John Gibbon (1827-1896) graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 1847 and carried out assignments in the Mexican-American War and The Third Seminole War (1855-1858). Â In between these conflicts, in 1854, he returned to West Point as an instructor of artillery tactics and eventually authored <em class="hi">The Artillerist's Manual</em>, a widely-read text which would become known as a definitive work on its subject. Gibbon served with distinction in the U.S. Army in several Civil War campaigns including as a general in the famous "Iron Brigade" of the Union Army of the Potomac. Gibbon served during the Great Sioux War of 1876; he and his troops being the first to reach the scene following the Battle of the Little Bighorn. A year later Gibbon and the Seventh Infantry pursued and engaged Chief Joseph's Nez Perce on their flight to sanctuary in Canada. In 1885 Gibbon was promoted to brigadier general, commanding the Department of the Columbia at Fort Vancouver, Washington, until he retired with the rank of major general in 1891.</div>
