      <div class="note">Thomas Duncan (1819-1887) enlisted in the Black Hawk War of 1832 at the age of thirteen. Fourteen years later he numbered among the original members of the newly formed Regiment of Mounted Rifles, originally as a first lieutenant and by March 15, 1848, as a captain. Duncan fought in the Mexican-American War of 1846-48. Stationed in the West during the Civil War, he commanded the Third U.S. Cavalry (formerly the Regiment of Mounted Rifles) at Fort Craig, New Mexico. He led troops at the Battle of Valverde in February, 1862. Four years later, in 1866, Duncan became lieutenant colonel of the Fifth U.S. Cavalry, for which William F. Cody served as a scout. Duncan retired from the service due to ill health in 1873 in that rank. Captain Jack Crawford once recalled that he and Cody "played one night at a fort at which General Duncan was stationed, and he and his wife came to see the performance." Crawford also remarked Duncan, like many frontier officers, over-imbibed on occasion.</div>
