      <div class="note">James Barnet Fry (1827-1894), USMA Class of 1847, received his commission as a second lieutenant in the Third U.S. Artillery. After graduation he spent a brief period as an assistant instructor in that branch but with the outbreak of the Mexican-American War of 1846-1848, he left West Point for occupation duty in Mexico City. From there he took on far-flung assignments from Fort Columbus, New York, to Fort Vancouver, Washington, as well as New Orleans Barracks, Fort Brown, Texas, and eventually back to West Point to teach gunnery from 1853 through 1859 as well as serving as the Academy's adjutant for five years. In 1859 he reported to the Artillery School of Practice at Fort Monroe, Virginia. When John Brown raided Harper's Ferry, Fry accompanied Robert E. Lee and a detachment of U.S. Marines to quell the siege on the arsenal. Over the next two years he continued his duties as an artillery officer. When the Civil War began he joined a battery of light artillery in Washington, D.C., but soon assumed temporary duties as an assistant in the adjutant general's department. He left Washington for a staff assignment under Irvin McDowell and spent much of the remainder of the war in similar capacities. Fry's administrative abilities brought him a posting as adjutant general of the Division of the Pacific (December 3, 1866-May 17, 1869), eventually followed by like duties in the Division of the Missouri (June 24, 1871-November 26, 1873), the vast command overseen by Philip H. Sheridan.  Based on frontier experiences during this time, which included some history relevant to William F. Cody's scouting days in Kansas, Fry authored <em class="hi">Army Sacrifices, or Briefs from Official Pigeon-holes</em> (1879) as well as other writings.  He retired as a colonel of the adjutant general's department on July 1, 1881. </div>
