      <div class="note">George Alexander "Sandy" Forsyth (1837-1915) enlisted as a private in the Chicago Dragoons on April 19, 1861. Within a few months he gained a commission as a first lieutenant in the Eighth Illinois Volunteer Cavalry, and served during the Civil War in the Army of the Potomac as well as later in the Army of the Shenandoah. He eventually attained the rank of brevet (honorary title of recognition but not a permanent rank) brigadier general of volunteers in recognition of "gallant and meritorious service" in such engagements in Virginia as Opequan, Fisher Hill, Middletown, and Five Forks. After the war Forsyth entered the regular army and received a commission as a major in the Ninth U.S. Cavalry (buffalo soldiers). In 1868, at General Philip H. Sheridan's order, Forsyth organized "Forsyth's Scouts," a band of fifty frontiersmen who served as a shock force in the Indian wars in Kansas and Colorado. That same year Forsyth's Scouts fought an engagement against several hundred Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapahoe warriors, which would come to be known as the Battle of Beecher's Island. For this action Forsyth received another brevet as brigadier general, but this time in the U.S. Army.  Forsyth went on to serve as military secretary and aide-de-camp to Sheridan, during which time he participated in Custer's Black Hills expedition of 1874.  Forsyth received the permanent rank of lieutenant colonel in the Fourth U.S. Cavalry in 1881 and retired from the army in 1890.</div>
