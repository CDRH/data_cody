   </h3>
   <p>
      <div class="note">After attending Yale Law School, Alfred Howe Terry (1827-1890) briefly practiced law before being appointed clerk of the Superior Court of New Haven, Connecticut. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he raised a regiment of volunteers for the Union Army and served with distinction in the eastern theater. After the war, Terry opted for a career in the military, ultimately rising to the rank of major general. During Terry's service as military commander of the Department of Dakota from 1866-1869 and again from 1872-1886, he was involved in negotiating the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, commanded the Dakota Column in the summer 1876 campaign of the Great Sioux War, and served as an envoy to Canada in October 1877, in an attempt to negotiate Sitting Bull's return to the United States. In 1886 Terry was promoted to major general and became commander of the U.S. Army's Great Plains forces, two years before his retirement and four years before his death. </div>
