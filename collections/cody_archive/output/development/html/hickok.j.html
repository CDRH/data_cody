   </h3>
   <p>
      <div class="note">James Butler "Wild Bill" Hickok (1837-1876), one of the most notable figures of the American West, was a lawman, gunfighter, marksman, professional gambler, and army scout. He served in the Union Army during the Civil War and gained publicity after the war for his exploits as a scout, marksman, and professional gambler. He was something of a hero to William F. Cody, who based a number of elements of his public image on Hickok. In 1873 Cody invited Hickok to join the Buffalo Bill Combination, along with John Burwell "Texas Jack" Omohundro (1846-1880), on stage in their new play, <em class="hi">Scouts of the Plains</em>; he left the Combination in March 1874. In March 1876 Hickok married Agnes Lake and thereafter organized gold prospectors in the Black Hills. In August 1876, while playing poker in a saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory, Hickok was shot and killed by Jack McCall; McCall was eventually found guilty and hanged for the crime.</div>
