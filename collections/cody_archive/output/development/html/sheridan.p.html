      <div class="note">Philip Henry Sheridan (1831-1888), a fearless and determined U.S. Army officer, played a key role in both the Civil War and the Indian Wars. He is known particularly for his defeat of Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley in 1864 and his role in forcing the surrender of General Robert Lee in 1865. He also contributed to the development of Yellowstone National Park and had risen to the rank of General of the Army by the time of his death. His own memoirs were published in two volumes as Personal Memoirs of P. H. Sheridan (New York: Charles L. Webster &amp; Company, 1888), and the key study of his role in the Indian Wars is Paul A. Hutton's Phil Sheridan and His Army (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1985).  It was Sheridan who engaged W. F. Cody as a scout, thereby starting the frontiersman on his incredible journey to fame.</div>
