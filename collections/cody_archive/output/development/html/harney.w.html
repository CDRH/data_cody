   <p>
      <div class="note">William Selby Harney (1800-1889) was a controversial military figure whose decades in uniform read like a novel. In 1818 he began his military career as a second lieutenant in the First U.S. Infantry. On January 7, 1819, he received his promotion to first lieutenant. Two years later he temporarily transferred to First U.S. Artillery, but would return to his old infantry regiment on December 21, 1822, making captain on May 14, 1825. The ambitious officer left the infantry on May 1, 1833, to become a major in the paymaster department, but not before participating in the sharp, brief Blackhawk War (1832) where Abraham Lincoln also served as a militiaman. On August 15, 1836, Harney returned to the combat arms, in this instance as the lieutenant colonel of the newly established Second U.S. Dragoons.  A decade later he became the regiment's colonel. During his time with the dragoons (the forerunner of the cavalry) he fought in the First Seminole War (1835-1842), the Mexican War (1846-1848), the First Sioux War (1854-1855), as well as serving during the "Bleeding Kansas" period, the Mormon Uprising (1857-1858), and the Civil War as a brigadier general, a rank he held since June 14, 1858. Harney retired from service in 1863 after having been relieved of his command of the Department of the Missouri in part due to perceived Confederate sympathies during the Missouri secession crisis. Harney later returned as a member of the Indian Peace Commission of 1867-1868, and was instrumental in the negotiation of several treaties. </div>
