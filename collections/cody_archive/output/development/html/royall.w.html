   <p>
      <div class="note">Virginia-born William Bedford Royall (1825-1895) was a career soldier who served as a lieutenant with the Missouri Mounted Volunteers during the Mexican-American War of 1846-48, and was commissioned as first lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Cavalry in 1855. He committed to the Union cause at the outbreak of the Civil War, serving with the Army of the Potomac and holding the rank of major and the brevet (honorary title of recognition but not a permanent rank) rank of colonel by the war's end. Royall served with the Fifth U.S. Cavalry on the western plains through 1875. It was with that regiment that he crossed paths with W. F. Cody, who spent considerable time with this unit as a scout. On December 2, 1875, Royall's promotion to lieutenant colonel brought him to the 3rd U.S. Cavalry, an assignment that placed him at the Battle of Rosebud Creek on June 17, 1876. During the so-called Great Sioux War of 1876-77, in addition to leading the Third, he also commanded five troops of the Second Cavalry. After Ranald S. McKenzie relinquished his command of the Fourth U.S. Cavalry in 1882, Royall rose to colonel of that regiment. In 1887 Royall retired with the rank of brigadier general.</div>
