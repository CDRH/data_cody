   <p>
      <div class="note">Winfield Scott Hancock (1824-1886) graduated from West Point in 1844 and served in the U.S. Army for more than four decades. His first assignment was Fort Gibson, Indian Territory (Oklahoma), as a second lieutenant in the Sixth U.S. Infantry. He then fought in the Mexican-American War of 1846-48 at the Battles of Churubusco and Molino del Rey, held administrative posts in Minnesota and Missouri, and went to Florida during the Third Seminole War (1855-1858). He subsequently transferred to Fort Leavenworth, during the "Bleeding Kansas" period. Hancock served with distinction in various campaigns in the Civil War, earning the nickname "the Thunderbolt of the Army of the Potomac." Hancock's postbellum promotion to major general in the U.S. Army included commanding the Department of the Missouri, where in 1867 he took part in field operations against the Plains Indians along with W. F. Cody and many other Civil War veterans. He went on as commander of the Division of the Atlantic and other command assignments such as the Department of Dakota from 1869 through 1872. Â In 1880 Hancock became the Democratic presidential nominee but was narrowly defeated by James A. Garfield.  Following the election, Hancock returned to the military and died in 1886 at Governor's Island, New York, while serving a second time in command of the Military Division of the Atlantic.</div>
