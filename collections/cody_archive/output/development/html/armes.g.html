   <p>
      <div class="note">George Augustus Armes (1844-1919) began his military life on September 1, 1862, as a private of Company B, Sixteenth West Virginia Volunteer Infantry. In a little over two months he rose to first lieutenant. Despite the promotion Armes elected to muster out of the regiment on June 10, 1863.  On July 1, 1863, he accepted a commission at the lower grade of a second lieutenant. Late the next year he resigned to become a captain in the Second New York Artillery, which brought him a brevet (honorary title of recognition but not a permanent rank) as a major of volunteers for gallantry and meritorious service during the campaign of 1864-1865. He left the service on September 29, 1865, but was able to secure an appointment as a second lieutenant in the Second U.S. Cavalry on April 19, 1866.  Within a matter of three months he managed to advance to captain of the Tenth U.S. Cavalry (buffalo soldiers) as commanding officer of Troop I posted to Kansas. It was here Armes met W. F. Cody, who served as a scout and hunted game to supply Armes' troops in the field. The captain admired Cody, who by then had been nicknamed "Buffalo Bill." Not one to pay compliments, Armes nevertheless recollected Cody was "one of our scouts and one of the best shots on the plainsâ€¦ He gets $60 per month and a splendid mule to ride, and is one of the most contented and happy men I ever met." The often contentious captain would be dismissed from the army on June 7, 1870, but reinstated with full back pay and rank of captain on May 11, 1878. He retired September 15, 1883.
