      <div class="note">George Armstrong Custer (1839-1876) graduated last in the class of 1861 at the United States Military Academy. Despite his poor West Point record he went on to a distinguished career as a Union officer, rising to the grade of major general of volunteers while still in his twenties. After the Civil War he gained a commission as lieutenant colonel of the Seventh U.S. Cavalry regiment. In 1872 he joined Grand Duke Alexis of Russia for an elaborate hunting expedition in the West. The party included Buffalo Bill Cody and Lieutenant General Philip Sheridan.  Four years later, on June 25, 1876, Custer died with much of his command at Little Big Horn, or as the native peoples knew it, the Greasy Grass River. From that day Custer began to transform from an historical figure to a legend, in part because of Cody's Wild West depiction of the fabled "Last Stand" that was performed in front of many thousands of audience members in North America and Europe. </div>
