      <div class="note">George R. Crook (1828-1890) graduated from West Point Military Academy in 1852 and with the exception of Civil War service spent his entire thirty-eight year army career on frontier duty. During the latter half of the 1860s Crook campaigned against the Bannock, Shoshone, and Paiute people from 1864-1868, and fought in the Great Sioux War of 1876-1877. His command suffered a defeat at the Battle of the Rosebud on June 17, 1876, but he obtained somewhat more notable, albeit spotty success in the Apache Wars of the Southwest where he received the nickname "Gray Fox." Crook spent the last part of his life advocating for the fair treatment of American Indians. Few army officers of the late 19th century matched his record in Indian affairs, in extensive field operations, negotiations, or in efforts to promote acculturation on the reservation.</div>
