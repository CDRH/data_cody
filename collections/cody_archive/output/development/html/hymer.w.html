   </h3>
   <p>
      <div class="note">William Ebert Hymer was born near Rushville, Illinois, in 1853.  He settled in Nebraska in 1878, where he became one of the first merchants in the new town of Holdrege in the early 1880s.  He later became involved in real estate and banking, and was the first cashier of the National Bank of Holdrege in 1888.  Hymer later became the bank's president. The bank went into receivership in March 1895.  Hymer was an early partner in the Cody Canal project but contributed little capital and was eventually forced out of the venture by the other partners.  He faced at least one lawsuit in Nebraska connected to the Holdrege bank failure.  Hymer went on to other business ventures in and around Red Lodge, Montana, where he died in 1933.</div>
