      <div class="note">William Tecumseh Sherman (1820-1891) was one of the best-known military figures of the nineteenth century. Sherman played a crucial role in the Union victory in the Civil War, famously developing policies that are often seen as the forerunner of twentieth-century "total war" tactics. Sherman advanced to Commanding General of the Army after Ulysses S. Grant became president in 1869. Thereafter he emerged as a key figure in the Indian Wars, during which he continued to employ harsh "scorched earth" tactics against his adversaries.</div>
