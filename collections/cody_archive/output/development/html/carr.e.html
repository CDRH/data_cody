   <p>
      <div class="note">Eugene Asa Carr (1830-1910) graduated from West Point in 1850. He served in the West until 1861, by which time he had been promoted to captain in the old First U.S. Cavalry and appointed commander of Fort Washita in Indian Territory (Oklahoma). Carr soon moved east to participate in numerous campaigns of the Civil War, which earned him the Medal of Honor for gallantry in action after being wounded at the Battle of Pea Ridge in March, 1862. Three years later Carr was appointed major general of volunteers. In 1866 President Andrew Johnson nominated Carr as a major general in the U.S. Army. Â After the Civil War he conducted several successful campaigns on the frontier, becoming known as "War Eagle." He arrived on the plains in October, 1868, as lieutenant colonel of the Fifth U.S. Cavalry, in which grade he took part in the battles of Summit Springs (1869) and Warbonnet  Creek (1876), two incidents which William F. Cody dramatized on stage and in Buffalo Bill's Wild West. Carr later dubbed Cody "king of all guides, scouts, trailers, and hunters." On April 29, 1879, Carr became the colonel of the Sixth U.S. Cavalry and served in the Apache campaigns in Arizona. He retired as a brigadier general in 1893.</div>
